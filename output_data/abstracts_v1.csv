100056,1990,international journal of industrial organization,cost overruns in long term projects,cost overruns in long term projects,"To evaluate the comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of various antihypertensive medications in persons aged 35 through 64 years with diastolic blood pressure of 95 mm Hg or greater and no known coronary heart disease, we used the Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model, which is a computer simulation of overall mortality as well as the mortality, morbidity, and cost of coronary heart disease in the US population. From the pooled literature, we estimated the antihypertensive and total cholesterol effects of various antihypertensive regimens. For 20 years of simulated therapy from 1990 through 2010, the cost per year of life saved was projected to be $10,900 for propranolol hydrochloride; $16,400 for hydrochlorothiazide; $31,600 for nifedipine; $61,900 for prazosin hydrochloride; and $72,100 for captopril. Doubling the cholesterol effects of the agents under study did not significantly change their effectiveness because, in general, lowering diastolic blood pressure by 1 mm Hg was equivalent to lowering the cholesterol level by 6%. Although any projection requires multiple estimates, each of which may be open to debate, propranolol appears to be the preferred initial option under most of a variety of alternative assumptions.

In this article we identify the components and assumptions of the official forecasts and approximate them by stochastic parametric models. We estimate parameters of the models from past data, derive statistical intervals for the forecasts, and compare them with the official high-low intervals. We use the models to evaluate the forecasts rather than to develop different predictions of the future. Analysis of data from 1972 to 1985 shows that the official intervals for mortality forecasts for males or females aged 45-70 have approximately a 95% chance of including the true mortality rate in any year. For other ages the chances are much less than 95%."" Collapse"
100219,1990,journal of the american statistical association,density estimation with confidence sets exemplified by superclusters and voids in the galaxies,density estimation with confidence sets exemplified by superclusters and voids in the galaxies,"Abstract A method is presented for forming both a point estimate and a confidence set of semiparametric densities. The final product is a three-dimensional figure that displays a selection of density estimates for a plausible range of smoothing parameters. The boundaries of the smoothing parameter are determined by a nonparametric goodness-of-fit test that is based on the sample spacings. For each value of the smoothing parameter our estimator is selected by choosing the normal mixture that maximizes a function of the sample spacings. A point estimate is selected from this confidence set by using the method of cross-validation. An algorithm to find the mixing distribution that maximizes the spacings functional is presented. These methods are illustrated with a data set from the astronomy literature. The measurements are velocities at which galaxies in the Corona Borealis region are moving away from our galaxy. If the galaxies are clustered, the velocity density will be multimodal, with clusters correspond... Collapse"
100226,1990,journal of the american statistical association,fast evaluation of the distribution of the durbin-watson and other invariant test statistics in time series regression,fast evaluation of the distribution of the durbin watson and other invariant test statistics in time series regression,"Abstract A method is given for evaluating p values in O(n) operations for a general class of invariant test statistics that can be expressed as the ratio of quadratic forms in time series regression residuals. The best known of these is the Durbin-Watson statistic, although several others have been discussed in the literature. The method is numerically exact in the sense that the user specifies the error tolerance at the outset. As with existing exact methods, the problem is reexpressed in terms of the distribution function of a single quadratic form in independent normals, which is evaluated by numerically inverting its characteristic function. Existing methods, however, calculate the characteristic function by reducing the matrix defining the quadratic form to either eigenvalue or tridiagonal form, each of which requires O(n 3) operations for sample size n, whereas the new method uses a modification of the Kalman filter to do it in O(n) operations. Moreover, the new method has minimal storage requiremen... Collapse"
100227,1990,journal of the american statistical association,on the behavior of randomization tests without a group invariance assumption,on the behavior of randomization tests without a group invariance assumption,"Abstract Fisher's randomization construction of hypothesis tests is a powerful tool to yield tests that are nonparametric in nature in that their level is exactly equal to the nominal level in finite samples over a wide range of distributional assumptions. For example, the usual permutation t test to test equality of means is valid without a normality assumption of the underlying populations. On the other hand, Fisher's randomization construction is not applicable in this example unless the underlying populations differ only in location. In general, the basis for the randomization construction is invariance of the probability distribution of the data under a transformation group. It is the goal of this article to understand the robustness properties of randomization tests by studying their asymptotic validity in situations where the basis for their construction breaks down. Here, asymptotic validity refers to whether the probability of a Type I error tends asymptotically to the nominal level. In particula... Collapse"
100228,1990,journal of the american statistical association,construction of permutation tests,construction of permutation tests,"1. I n t r o d u c t i o n Randomness have been playing an ever increasing role in computer science. The demand for cheap random bits and repeatabil i ty of random experiments have resulted in the need for pseudorandom generators. Clearly one has to be careful in the design of a pseudorandom generator to make sure that the output behaves ""randomly"". Classically this meant that the sequence produced by the generator passed certain statistical tests (see Knuth [K]). This point of view was dramatically changed in 1982 by the papers by Blum and Micali IBM] and Yao [Y]. One important change was a new definition of what should be required of a pseudorandom generator, namely its output should be indistinguishable from truly random bits by all probabilistic polynomial t ime algorithms. The second important contribution was the construction of pseudorandom generators satisfying this new stringent definition (under some specific assumption). Blum and Micali's generator IBM] was proved secure under the assumption that the discrete logar i thm problem was hard and Yao generalized this to show how to construct a secure generator from any oneway permutat ion. Of course it would be very nice to prove that a given generator is secure without any assumptions, Permission to copy without fee all or part of this material is granted provided that the copies are not made or distributed for direct commercial advantage, the ACM copyright notice and the title of the publication and its date appear, and notice is given that copying is by permission of the Association for Computing Machinery. To copy otherwise, or to republish, requires a fee and/or specific permission. but to unconditionally prove that a generator is secure is at least as difficult as proving that N P ~ P and thus this seems too much to ask for. The next best thing is to investigate exactly what assumptions are required. In 1985, Levin [L] proved that necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a secure generator is the existence of a function which is oneway on its iterates. This condition is not, however, completely natural and thus the search for more natural conditions continued. Goldreich, Krawczyk and Luby [GKL] gave a construction for a secure generator given the existence of a regular oneway function. Then recently, Impagliazzo, Levin and Luby JILL] proved that the existence of a oneway function in the nonuniform model (i.e. cannot be inverted by polynomial size circuits) implies the existence of nonuniformly secure generators (i.e. cannot be distinguished from random bits by polynomial size circuits). Their teclmique did not extend to show that the existence of a oneway function in the uniform model guarantees the existence of generators which are uniformly secure, and the main open question in the area was to prove that this is the case. The main result of this paper is to indeed prove that oneway functions in the uniform model imply uniformly secure generators. Since it is easy to see that secure generators imply oneway functions we have hence obtained natural necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of secure generators. Our construction uses mostly the same ideas as [ILL]. A key concept of JILL] is that of a false entropy generator (FEG). A function g is a FEG if the distribution G generated by picking a random x and computing g(x) is indistinguishable from a distribution D, where D has higher entropy than G. In the uniform case we also want D to be polynomial time samplable i.e. that there is a probabilistic polynomial t ime algorithm that outputs a random element from D: JILL] proved that the existence of a FEG implies the existence of a secure pseudorandom generator (this has been strengthened by Oded Go, tire© 1990 ACM 089791-361-2/90/0005/0395 $1.50 395 ich [G] to show that if there are two distributions that computationally indistinguishable but statistically different then there exists secure generators). Let f be a oneway permutat ion and b a predicate that is hard to approximate given the information f (x) . Consider g(x) = (f(~:), b(x)) and let G be the distribution generated by g on a random input. Since b is hard to approximate, G is indistinguishable from D = (f(x), r) where r is a random bit and D has higher entropy than G since if f is a permutation, then f (x) determines z and hence b(z) uniquely. Thus g is a FEG. It seems like this construction on top of a oneway function f needs a predicate b which is hard given f . However by the elegant result by Goldreich and Levin [GL] we know that we can always take b to be a random xor. Let us now turn to the case where f is not a permutation. In this case ( f (x ) ,b (z ) ) is still indistinguishable from (f(x), r) but g might still not be a FEG. The reason is that f ( x ) does not any more determine b(x) and hence it is not clear that changing b(x) to a random bit increases the entropy, fILL] solved this problem by output t ing also a hashfunction h(x) in order to determine x uniquely, and letting g'(x) = (f(z) , h(z), b(x)). The corresponding distribution G ~ now has lower entropy then the distribution given by ( f (x) , h(z), r) where r is a random bit. However, releasing extra information about x might help an algorithm that tries to invert f and if h(x) outputs too many bits, the mapping x (f(z), h(x)) might not be oneway and thus the output of g' could be distinguishable from (f(x), h(z), r). It turns out that it is both profitable and safe to change b(x) to a random bit when h outputs approximately log i f -1 ( f(z)) I bits. However this creates a nonuniform competing distribution (since cannot compute this number) and this is the source of the nonuniformity of fILL]. We get around this problem by generating many xi and computing f(xi), b(xi) and h(xi) for hash functions of random sizes. We then output all f(xi), h(xi), 11~[1~ and M where M is random matrix and B is the vector of the b(xi) values. If the size of M is chosen correctly this is indistinguishable from the distribution where everything is identical except that B is chosen randomly and this latter distribution has a higher entropy. The main difficulty in the proof is to prove that MB is indistinguishable from M Y where Y is picked randomly. The proof of this is similar to the proof of Levin [L] of the sharp version of Yao's XOR-lemma. The present lemma proves more than is needed for the present application. Namely, we prove that if B consists of bits that each can be guessed with probability at most (1 + p)/2 (over the input and the coinflips of the algorithm) then the conclusion follows (for suitable choice for the size of M). However, in our application, with probability 1 p (over the input), no probabilistic polynomial time algorithm can gain any significant advantage over guessing, and with probability p (over the input) the bit might be totally predictable. Using this stronger property it is possible to give a simpler proof. This simpler proof will appear in a forthcoming journal paper, which will be a combination of the present paper and fILL]. In this paper we prove the stronger lemma by the more complicated proof since we believe that the stronger version of the lemma is interesting on its"
100229,1990,journal of the american statistical association,a monte carlo implementation of the em algorithm and the poor man's data augmentation algorithms,a monte carlo implementation of the em algorithm and the poor mans data augmentation algorithms,"Abstract The first part of this article presents the Monte Carlo implementation of the E step of the EM algorithm. Given the current guess to the maximizer of the posterior distribution, latent data patterns are generated from the conditional predictive distribution. The expected value of the augmented log-posterior is then updated as a mixture of augmented log-posteriors, mixed over the generated latent data patterns (multiple imputations). In the M step of the algorithm, this mixture is maximized to obtain the update to the maximizer of the observed posterior. The gradient and Hessian of the observed log posterior are also expressed as mixtures, mixed over the multiple imputations. The relation between the Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm and the data augmentation algorithm is noted. Two modifications to the MCEM algorithm (the poor man's data augmentation algorithms), which allow for the calculation of the entire posterior, are then presented. These approximations serve as diagnostics for the validity o... Collapse"
100230,1990,journal of the american statistical association,a frequency domain selection criterion for regression with autocorrelated errors,a frequency domain selection criterion for regression with autocorrelated errors,"Abstract We consider the regression model yt = η t + e t , t = 0, 1, …, n − 1, where y t are scalar observations, η t is the unknown regression function, and e t are unobservable errors generated by a zero-mean weakly stationary process, independent of η t and with completely unknown autocorrelation structure. We propose a data-driven method for selecting a parametric or nonparametric estimator of η t . The method is based on cross-validation in the frequency domain and requires no assumptions about the form of the estimator or the error correlations. It does, however, require the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the signal η t to be a smooth complex function of frequency, as is the case, for example, with transient signals or growth and decay curves. After giving some general motivations for the method, we focus on the special case of linear estimators of a nonparametric regression function, including both kernel and spline estimators. For these estimators, we develop efficient methods of evaluating t... Collapse"
100231,1990,journal of the american statistical association,calibrating prediction regions,calibrating prediction regions,"Abstract Suppose that the variable X to be predicted and the learning sample Yn that was observed have a joint distribution, which depends on an unknown parameter θ. The parameter θ can be finite- or infinite-dimensional. A prediction region Dn for X is a random set, depending on Yn , that contains X with prescribed probability α. This article studies methods for controlling simultaneously the conditional coverage proability of Dn , given Yn , and the overall (unconditional) coverage probability of Dn . The basic construction yields a prediction region Dn , which has the following properties in regular models: Both the conditional and overall coverage probabilities of Dn converge to α as the size n of the learning sample increases. The convergence of the former is in probability. Moreover, the asymptotic distribution of the conditional coverage probability about α is typically normal; and the overall coverage probability tends to α at rate n −1.

These results demonof mixing characteristics in wheat flours. A good range of variation in strate that the 2-g mixograph meets the requirements for use in early mixograph parameters (each with acceptable errors of determination) was generation selection for wheat quality. The value of the instrument was found for flours derived from the seed of F2, single-plant selections and confirmed by simulated selection based on guideline values for two wheat in their F3 progeny. The results agreed well over years for the important grades and the response to selection as measured using realized heritability variables of time to maximum resistance (mixing time) and tolerance estimates. to mixing (resistance breakdown), as evidenced by the medium-to-high Cereal laboratories involved with wheat breeding programs continually develop and evaluate new procedures that can be applied to early generation selection for wheat quality. Such procedures must be simple, rapid, and reliable, and they must use only a small quantity of seed, have high correlations with end-use properties, and retain their predictive capacity independent of the location or year of growth. The advantages of such early generation testing procedures are that they result in more efficient use of limited cereal laboratory and breeding resources. Subsequent costly tests for field plot disease resistance, yield, milling, physical dough properties, and baking need only be conducted on lines that have an enhanced probability of having acceptable end-use quality. Early generation quality tests are many and varied in type, ranging from sedimentation tests of wheat meals and flour (e.g., Zeleny volume, sodium dodecyl sulfate volume, alkaline waterretention capacity) or yeasted wheat meal or flour dough balls (e.g., Pelshenke time) to varied flour-water dough mixing tests (e.g., mixograph [TMCO, Lincoln, NE] and farinograph [Brabender, Duisberg, Germany]), and microscale test baking procedures (MacRitchie and Gras 1973, Shogren and Finney 1984). The results of testing for kernel hardness, protein content, and rate of dough development have been shown to provide adequate prediction of test loaf quality (Fowler and de la Roche 1975a). Each of these parameters showed considerable, although population dependent, genetic variation (Fowler and de la Roche 1975b). Similarly, response to early generation selection has been reported for the use of measures of kernel hardness, protein content, and small-scale tests correlated with dough strength such as sodium dodecyl sulfate volume, percent residue protein, Zeleny volume, and Pelshenke time (Fischer et al 1989, O'Brien et al 1989). The use of a mixograph employing 10 g of flour (Finney and Shogren 1972) has enabled breeders to select directly for physical dough properties in early generations. The need to mill at least 15 g of seed to produce the flour for this purpose may have restricted its application in early generations in many breeding programs. A smaller recording mixer utilizing 5 g of flour has been reported recently (Finney 1989). A test that required even smaller sample sizes (2 g of flour obtained from 3-5 g of seed) would have many applications. It could be widely used in laboratories for basic research on wheat quality where quantity of sample is a major limitation. However, 'This is the written version of a paper presented at the 76th annual meeting of the AACC, held in Seattle, WA, October 13-16, 1991. 2 Grain Quality Research Laboratory, CSIRO Division of Plant Industry, P.O.

Seed from single plants, progeny rows, or yield plots could be evaluated. The applicability of an early generation test relies not only on its correlation with standard measures of wheat quality, but also on the response measurable within segregating breeding populations in the generation following selection. This article reports the use of a direct-drive 2-g mixograph (Rath et al 1990) to determine the physical dough properties of flours from F2 singleplant selections. The accuracy and effectiveness of the procedure was evaluated on the resulting F3 progeny. MATERIALS AND METHODS Single plant-selections from the F2 generation of three crosses, Suneca/ Sunfield (SS), Vasco/ Hartog/ / Vasco (VH), and Sunbird/Dollarbird (SD), and their derived F3 lines were used in this study. In the F2 generation single plants were selected from space-planted rows on the basis of having acceptable straw strength, lodging resistance, height, flowering time, and maturity for the target region of the breeding program (northern NSW, Australia). Seed of the single plants was stored in a seed room for a minimum period of three weeks until it had equilibrated to approximately 12% moisture content. Ten grams of seed was preconditioned to 15% moisture content for 24 hr before being milled with a Quadrumat Junior flour mill (Brabender, Duisberg, Germany) fitted with a sieving screen covered with 9XX silk mesh. The milling procedure followed was similar to that described by Whan (1974). In the F3 generation the lines were sown in separate two-replicate experiments with randomized complete block designs, one for each cross. Each experiment included the parents of the cross and the varieties Sunco, Hartog, and Sunelg as checks. Plots were harvested with a plot combine, and a 10-g subsample of each replicate was milled to flour following the same procedures as for the F2 generation. Flour protein contents were determined by near-infrared reflectance spectrometry, using a calibration based on Kjeldahl analysis (protein = N X 5.7). All flours were equilibrated for 72 hr at 220 C with air at 60% relative humidity to obtain a moisture content of approximately 12.8% before mixograph testing (Bushuk and Winkler 1957). Water additions for mixing tests were calculated according to a formula relating water addition to flour moisture and protein content (AACC 1983). Mixing parameters were obtained with a prototype recording dough mixer (TMCO, Lincoln, NE) employing 2 g of flour per measurement (Rath et al 1990). Mixing parameters were obtained by automated interpretation of the recorded data using specially written software (Gras et al 1990). Mixing parameters were measured from the center line of the recorded data after 254 CEREAL CHEMISTRY smoothing, using a 25-sec moving mean. Parameters measured were time to maximum resistance and time to maximum bandwidth (both in minutes), maximum resistance (maximum height of the mixing curve), bandwidth at maximum resistance, breakdown in resistance, breakdown in bandwidth, and maximum bandwidth (reported in a 100-unit scale, where 0 and 100 correspond to the minimum and maximum deflection on a standard 35-g mixograph). Resistance and bandwidth breakdowns were defined as the decreases in resistance and bandwidth, respectively, measured 3 min after maximum resistance. The limited quantity of seed available from the F2 single-plant selections, combined with the predetermined quantity needed to plant the F3 generation, did not permit remilling of additional samples for repeats of mixographs that were discarded because of operator error. This resulted in a lower number of paired samples (F2 to F3) for the SD cross. Statistical analyses were performed by standard procedures using the MSUSTAT package of statistical analysis programs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In each generation, a wide range of values was found for most of the dough properties measured by the 2-g mixograph. The means and ranges for these parameters and the flour protein content in the F2 and F3 generations are shown in Table I. The skewnesses of the data were usually less than one with the exception of the data for the mix time of the F2 generation of the VH cross, where the skewness was 1.16. These results indicate that these crosses were a suitable sample to evaluate the effectiveness of the 2-g mixograph for early generation testing of doughmixing properties. The duplicate mixographs of the F2 generation flours indicate that in most cases the measurements of dough properties have acceptably low errors of determination (Table I). A wide range of values and low errors of determination are both prerequisites for the application of the 2-g mixograph to early generation selection. An analysis of variance of the duplicate mixographs of each field replicate for all lines of all crosses in the F3 generation indicated significant differences at the 0.001 level of probability between lines for the estimates of time to maximum resistance (mixing time), maximum resistance, resistance breakdown (tolerance to overmixing), and time to maximum bandwidth. Of these, time to maximum resistance and resistance breakdown are the most meaningful measures of dough quality (Hoseney and Finney 1974, Fowler and de la Roche 1975a). Significant block effects (field replication) were apparent for a number of variables, but these, like the few interactions between line and block, were not considered important because of the consistent differences between lines for mixograph properties in each cross. Offspring-parent heritability estimates (Frey and Horner 1957) for flour protein content and the mixograph parameters (Table II) indicated that medium-to-high values were obtained for a number of measures. For the population pooled over crosses, significant heritabilities were obtained for all parameters. However, some estimates, although stati Collapse"

Hadi (1988) shows that no general closed-form equation can relate the singular values of X to the singular values of X with one row deleted and gives closed-form approximations to the relationship between the singular values of the two matrices. In this article, we extend Hadi's results to the more general case of multiple-row deletion, carry out systematic numerical investigations to determine the goodness and the speed of the approximation, and give an example using real-life data to illustrate the usefulness of the results in diagnosing jointly influential observations in linear regression. The methods presented in this article deal with the computational as well as the data analytic aspects of problems arising in multivariate data analysis.

It is also assumed that rank {Φ(1)} = r, r = m − d, so that each component of the first differences W t = Y t − Y t − 1 is stationary. The relation of the model to error correction models and co-integration (Engle and Granger 1987) is discussed. The process {Y t } has the error correction representation Φ*(L)(1 − L)Y t = −P 2(I r − Λ r )Q 2 1 Y t-1 + e t , where Q(I m − Φ(1))P = J = diag(I d , Λ r ) is in Jordan canonical form and Q' = [Q 1, Q 2].

100247,1990,journal of the american statistical association,state-dependent utilities,state dependent utilities,"Several axiom systems for preference among acts lead to the existence of a unique probability and a state-independent utility such that acts are ranked according to their expected utilities. These axioms have been used as a foundation for Bayesian decision theory and the subjective probability calculus. In this paper, we note that the uniqueness of the probability is relative to the choice of what counts as a constant outcome. Although it is sometimes clear what should be considered constant, there are many cases in which there are several possible choices. Each choice can lead to a different “unique” probability and utility. By focusing attention on state-dependent utilities, we determine conditions under which a truly unique probability and utility can be determined from an agent’s expressed preferences among acts. Suppose that an agent’s preference can be represented in terms of a probability P and a utility U. That is, the agent prefers one act to another if and only if the expected utility of the one act is higher than that of the other. There are many other equivalent representations in terms of probabilities Q, which are mutually absolutely continuous with P, and state-dependent utilities V, which differ from U by possibly different positive affine transformations in each state of nature. An example is described in which two different but equivalent state-independent utility representations exist for the same preference structure. What differs between the two representations is which acts count as constants. The acts involve receiving different amounts of one or the other of two currencies and the states are different exchange rates between the currencies. It is easy to see how it would not be possible for constant amounts of both currencies to simultaneously have constant values across the different states. Savage (Foundations of statistics. John Wiley, New York, 1954, sec. 5.5) discovered a situation in which two seemingly equivalent preference structures are represented by different pairs of probability and utility. Savage attributed the phenomenon to the construction of a “small world”. We show that the small world problem is just another example of two different, but equivalent, representations treating different acts as constants. Finally, we prove a theorem (similar to one of Karni, Decision making under uncertainty. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1985) that shows how to elicit a unique state-dependent utility and does not assume that there are prizes with constant value. To do this, we define a new hypothetical kind of act in which both the prize to be awarded and the state of nature are determined by an auxiliary experiment. Collapse"

100256,1990,journal of the american statistical association,food stamp payment error rates:  can state-specific performance standards be developed?,food stamp payment error rates   can state specific performance standards be developed ,"Abstract Since 1981 the Food and Nutrition Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture has imposed financial penalties on 49 states with excessive overpayment errors in the Food Stamp program, many in more than one year, for a total of $423.5 million. Almost all have appealed the sanctions, and several have taken their appeal to the courts, questioning the fairness of the financial penalties. Although the quality control (QC) system holds all states to the same standard, payment error rates (defined as the proportion of total benefits paid erroneously) may reflect not only the administrative performance of an agency, but also the difficulty of the case load served and the characteristics of the social environment in which the program operates. To investigate the feasibility of adjusting states' overpayment error rates for differences on such external factors, we developed regression models for five components of the overpayment error rate. When fitted to the case-level data from the fiscal year (FY) 1984 QC s... Collapse"
100280,1990,journal of banking and finance,performance of currency portfolios chosen by a bayesian technique: 1967-1985,performance of currency portfolios chosen by a bayesian technique  1967 1985,"Abstract This paper is about normative currency portfolio rules. It assumes logarithmic investors who maximize the expected utility from lognormal currency returns with and without short sales restrictions. A number of implementable portfolio diversification policies are tried out on a large body of data covering nine major currencies and eighteen years of weekly observations. In doing so, we present ways of dealing with the ‘estimation risk’ in an international context. The necessary mean and covariance inputs are provided by a Bayesian prior on the means and by sample means and covariance matrices, which are estimated from weekly sample data. While some policies do produce abnormal returns (over and beyond proper reward for risk), none does so in a statistically significant way. This means that the evidence does not allow one to conclude that market participants are improperly diversified. As a byproduct of this investigation, techniques are found which would allow portfolio managers to earn a proper reward for risk by following a purely mechanical procedure; such techniques may be valuable in a multi-country world where the aggregate portfolio of currencies and securities is unknown and is not supposed to be efficient.

These internal-adjustment costs are those borne directly by firms purchasing new-capital goods and include such costs as those associated with setting up the new capital, learning the operation of the new equipment, and assimilating the new factors into the production process. Such costs need not be explicit, as in the cost of training programs, but can take the form of a reduction in ordinary output, such as resources diverted from the production of regular output to accommodate the adjustment costs of new investment. (Internal-adjustment costs should be distinguished from the well-known external costs of adjustment, such as the increasing marginal resource costs of delivering the desired level of capital goods to industries.) Failure to consider these costs can have far-reaching effects in several areas. One such area is the analysis of the impact of new investment on output and productivity. If these internal-adjustment costs are significant and important, the Collapse"

The empirical results point to the ‘made-to-measure’ nature of the tariff structure, i.e., relatively inefficient industries were granted higher rates of protection. The relative inefficiency measure which was derived from the CES production function kept a high explanatory power, along a wide range of substitution elasticities. The empirical results also show that in the early 1960s, tariffs favoured low-wage, labor-intensive industries; while in the late 1970s, industries with high levels of concentration lobbied successfully for higher levels of protection.

While the method requires some knowledge of the initial UMM assets and the growth rate of the monetary multiplier, it is virtually parameter-free in measuring the effects of asset substitution on the relative size of the UMM. For illustrative purpose it is applied to Korea, which appears to provide satisfactory results, indicating the usefulness of the method. Collapse"

Inferences about the regulation's success are drawn from farm-level, panel data from Sao Paulo in the early 1980s. Membership in the target group should have a positive effect in an ‘access rule’, relating farmers' characteristics to their probability of receiving credit. When allowing for time-invariant individual effects, possibly correlated with target group indicators, tests indicate that the regulation had no effect.

Profit sharing does not have a direct job creation effect as long as firms set the pay parameters. Yet the new system may have long-run effects on employment allocation. Under some circumstances profit sharing may in fact destabilize short-run employment such that jobs last for a shorter duration. Modern sector wages are then raised to discipline workers and urban unemployment goes up. Arguments are also given for the hypothesis that profit sharing stabilizes short-run employment with the opposite results. Collapse

The decline in activity rates was explained with the help of the hypothesis of a U-shaped impact of economic development on them. Among the most important findings were the considerable discouraging effect on labor force participation of unemployment and the negative impact of education. Women's hidden unemployment was found to be two to three times larger than reported unemployment. Collapse"

100346,1990,journal of development economics,corruption and allocation efficiency,corruption and allocation efficiency,"Corruption and targeting failures in the delivery of public services in developing countries has frequently been argued to result from absence of controls on the behavior of central bureaucrats delegated authority over service delivery. This has motivated recent initiatives towards decentralization of service procurement and delivery to elected local governments expected to be more accountable to user interests. However if local democracy is prone to capture by local elites, decentralization can also be subject to diversion and targeting failures. This paper presents a simple analytical framework to evaluate the resulting trade-off, and predict the effects of decentralization on volume and allocation of service delivery under different financing mechanisms. Consistent with existing cross-country empirical evidence, we find that greater fiscal autonomy of local governments expands the volume of service delivery, but this tends to be accompanied by service overprovision to local elites at the expense of non-elites. Restrictions on the ability of local governments to raise local taxes can accordingly be justified on efficiency and equity grounds. User fee mechanisms ensure that decentralization welfare dominates centralization, irrespective of the degree of local capture. Collapse"
100366,1990,journal of econometrics,are consumption-based intertemporal capital asset pricing models structural?,are consumption based intertemporal capital asset pricing models structural ,"Abstract Hansen and Singleton (1982) and Dunn and Singleton (1986) have found supporting evidence for the overidentifying restrictions of two empirical consumption-based asset pricing models, when estimated with a particular set of single asset returns. In this paper, we submit these models to further scrutiny by testing whether they exhibit (structural) stability. A series of tests, recently developed by Ghysels and Hall (1990), are applied and a test for structuralinvariance is introduced based on the likelihood ratio type test procedure of Eichenbaum, Hansen, and Singleton (1988). There are a number of reasons why structural stability tests are particularly appropriate for diagnostic testing of Euler equation models, namely: (1) the Lucas econometric policy evaluation critique; (2) Euler equations are only a partial description of the data-generating process and parameter stability is one of the few assumptions imposed in their estimation via the generalized method of moments; and finally (3) it is demonstrated that Hansen's overidentifying restrictions test has no power against a class of local alternatives characterized by a parameter drift.

These frontiers give the lower bounds on the standard deviations as a function of the mean. In this paper we develop a strategy for utilizing conditioning information efficiently, and hence improve on the standard deviation bounds computed by Hansen and Jagannathan. We implement this strategy empirically by using the seminonparametric (SNP) methodology suggested by Gallant and Tauchen (1989) to estimate the conditional distribution of a vector of monthly asset payoffs. We use the fitted conditional distributions to calculate both conditional and unconditional standard deviation bounds for the IMRS. The unconditional bounds are as sharp as possible subject to robustness considerations. We also use the fitted distributions to compute the moments of various candidate marginal rates of substitution suggested by economic theory, and in particular the time-nonseparable preferences of Dunn and Singleton (1986) and Eichenbaum and Hansen (1990). For these preferences, our findings suggest that habit persistence will put the moments of the IMRS inside the frontier at reasonable values of the curvature parameter. At the same time we uncover evidence that the implied IMRS fails to satisfy all of the restrictions inherent in the Euler equation. The findings help explain why Euler equation estimation methods typically find evidence in favor of local durability instead of habit persistence for monthly data. Collapse"
100387,1990,journal of economics and business,is normative portfolio theory dead?,is normative portfolio theory dead,"Quite a heated debate has been raging in Finance Theory since the early 1990?s regarding the relevance of Modern Portfolio Theory. Yet both adversaries are overlooking something very fundamental that could in fact bring them much closer. My working paper on the Market Indifference Curve provides this missing link: it allows for the integration of what investors refer to as ?sentiment? in the efficient pricing of risk by rational investors. Specifically, it demonstrates that (even) in the context of rational investors, the fair price of total risk at any time t reflects the aggregate ? not absolute or unanimous! ? risk aversion among investors at that time. If only anecdotic, intuitively such interpretation corresponds closely to what we observe when monitoring spread risk: the continuous consensual pricing of the risk premium by investors. When next, as Behavioral Finance proscribes, ?non-rational? behavior such as excessive optimism and excessive pessimism enters the equation, periods of substantial consensual mispricing of risk (herd behavior) may occur indeed, yet still based on the same premise: the efficient market reflects the consensus price of risk. In sum, the rational investor is alive and kicking and in principle at any time t the market efficiently provides the fair consensual price of risk. However, irrespective of whether investors are rational or not, this fair price of risk ? a time sensitive consensual phenomenon by default ? should be distinguished from the (incorrect) notion of an unanimous or absolute price of risk.

100393,1990,journal of economics and business,implementing the growth-optimal policy for choosing portfolios,implementing the growth optimal policy for choosing portfolios,"Abstract In this paper we compare practical procedures for implementing the well-known “growth-optimal” strategy for managing portfolios. The policy involves choosing in each investment period the portfolio that maximizes the expectation of the logarithm of the portfolio's return. We consider two vesions of the decision rule—the expected-log function itself and two-monent approximation of it—and three procedures for determining ex ante expectations of returns. In addition to a nonparametric approach, we examine two parametric models, one that takes returns to be jointly lognormal and a second that imposes a single-factor structure on the logs of returns. The relative performance of the six procedures is compared using data for indexes of securities and for the individual stocks in the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. Our main conclusion is that relatively simple methods for carrying out the growth-optimal program work about as well as methods that are computationally difficult. While naively analyzing historical returns cannot be relied upon to provide above-average performance, there are indications that performance can be improved by giving higher weight to the most recent returns.

Two aspects emphasized include the role of dividend policy and the behavior of the stock market. Both permanent and temporary tax changes are considered, with the transitional adjustment paths being characterized in detail. The contrast between the short-run and long-run effects is highlighted. In particular, an increase in any of the tax rates will cause short-run employment to fall, and with the capital stock fixed instantaneously, the capital-labor ratio immediately rises. Over time, as the capital stock declines, the capital-labor ratio falls. Collapse"

Methods Data were collected with a questionnaire sent by e-mail to CSII-experienced Diabetes Centers. The questionnaire assessed: (1) number of CSII-treated patients; (2) patient demographic data and characteristics; (3) structure and organization of Diabetes Centers providing CSII therapy; (4) pump characteristics (conventional pump, sensor-augmented pump); and (5) CSII dropouts.ResultsA total of 217 out of 1093 Italian centers participated: 51 pediatric (23.5 %) and 166 (76.5 %) adult centers (AP). Compared to a survey performed in 2005, there was a significant increase in the number of pediatric units when compared to adult units (112 vs 37 %, respectively, p < 0.05). Pediatric age is characterized by a greater concern for quality of life and injections, and a higher dropout rate (10.6 vs 8.9 %) mainly related to pump wearability and site reactions. A complete diabetes-care team is associated with a superior use of technology (fewer dropouts, increased CGM and advanced bolus use) which is, however, still used in a small percentage of patients.ConclusionsIn Italy, the number of CSII-treated pediatric patients (PP) is growing more significantly when compared to adults. Only 60 % of all patients are using advanced functions and 20 % are using CGMs continuously. This confirms the great interest in diabetes technology that is growing in pediatric diabetologists. However, much improvement is warranted in the organization and specialized training of pediatric, adult and transitional facilities. Collapse"

The present paper is an attempt to reconsider the question by applying some methods from the theory of nonlinear dynamics, especially bifurcation theory, to the analysis of a dynamic model with sluggish price adjustment. It is argued that, when inflation plays a destabilizing role through the Mundell effect, a stable closed orbit representing the perfect-foresight dynamics of the output-inflation pair may appear in the vicinity of a stationary state. Moreover, bifurcation theory is applied to find analytical results about the relation between the amplitude of the cycles and the ‘degree’ of flexibility of prices. This relation is shown to be positive in a variety of cases. Collapse"

The interaction of the entrants leads to surprising ambiguities. For example, lowering the incumbent's payoff to predation for all types can increase the probability of predation, slowing entry.

Seasonal structure is built into these models in either of two equivalent ways: periodically varying the coefficient matrices of a formerly nonseasonal problem or embedding this periodic-coefficient problem in a higher-dimensional sparse system whose time-invariant matrices have a special pattern of zero blocks. The former structure is compact and convenient computationally; the latter can be used to apply familiar convergence results from the theory of time-invariant optimal regulator problems.

100460,1990,journal of economic history,bank entry and the low issue of national bank notes:  a re-examination,bank entry and the low issue of national bank notes   a re examination,"Economic historians have long been puzzled by the low issue of national bank notes between 1882 and 1891. Circulation fell over 50 percent from $360 million in 1882 to $171 million in 1891 (see Table 1). Yet over that same period the number of national banks more than doubled. In 1890, when circulation had almost reached its lowest point, a confused Comptroller of the Currency wrote that new banks ""are now being organized with greater rapidity than in any time for the past twenty-five years.""1 Since bank note issue was the major privilege associated with a national bank charter, the anomaly of record numbers entering the system and ignoring note issue has puzzled historians. There are two long-standing theories explaining low note issue. The comptroller's theory links bank note profitability to the price of U.S. government bonds used as collateral to back note issue. Bond prices began rising in the mid-1880s, making note issue less profitable. Banks sold their bonds at a premium and circulation contracted. Note issue rebounded when the bond premiums disappeared after the treasury ran deficits for four consecutive years following the Panic of 1893. This theory was unchallenged until John James focused on the local lending rate as the key variable in determining profitability.3 James argued that a national bank faced two options after accepting a deposit: loan the deposit directly or purchase U.S. bonds as collateral and issue notes. The wider the spread between the loan rate and the bond rate, the more likely a bank would loan the deposit directly rather than tie up funds in low earning bonds. This opportunity-cost approach predicts that note issue should have been lower in regions with higher local lending rates (the South, Midwest, and Pacific). As regional interest rate differentials narrowed, around the turn of the century, note issue became more profitable in the South and West and circulation increased. Local lending rates and bond prices were important variables in determining profitability, but they ignored bank entry and have not adequately explained changes in circulation. I argue that changes in the regulatory environment help greatly to explain the movements in circulation and increased bank entry. The reduction in circulation can be traced to an 1882 change in the law that allowed banks to divest their bond holdings. The law also reduced barriers to entry and made national banking attractive to potential entrants. Circulation rebounded in 1900 when another change in the law made note issue more profitable and induced new banks to enter the system.4 Collapse"

I apply their methodology to ten Latin American countries. Examining the behavior of the Latin American economies is important in several respects: these countries were hit first by and reacted earlier to the effects of the Depression; they were part of the ""periphery"" and their policies did not directly affect the behavior of the ""center""; and their experience during the 1930s led them to select a subsequent inward-oriented path of development, based on import substitution.2 This model of development built upon a particular set of social and economic structures that were seen as shaping the world economic order, notably a center and a periphery with different structures of production. Unlike those of the periphery, the industrialized economies of the center are self-sustained; specifically, the periphery is constrained by an export sector confined to a very small range of goods and offering only limited backward and forward linkages with the rest of the economy.3 This note shows that Latin America reacted in the same way to depreciation as did Europe, and so offers evidence against the argument that Latin American economies were structurally constrained during this period.

One is the increasing strain on, and eventual structural failure of, centralized planning in virtually all of the self-styled socialist world. The other, less dramatic, but of no less historical significance, is the continued success of capitalism in its major strongholds. In both cases, I use as the crucial but not sole indicator of success or failure the political fortunes of the two social orders. There have been economic successes for socialism-above all, the initial industrialization of the USSR and the early modernization of China; there have been economic failures of capitalisminstability, uneven growth, unsatisfactory income distributions, dangerous international imbalances. From the perspective of the present, however, the half century is remarkable for the political verdict that has finally been passed on the two systems. With few exceptions, socialism has experienced a public delegitimization without precedent in modern, perhaps in all, history; whereas despite its failures, capitalism has enjoyed an uncontestable, and probably rising degree of internal political support. In this paper I shall be concerned only indirectly with these historical developments, for my purpose is neither to describe nor to explain the contrasting fates of the two great social orders. Rather, I wish to review and interpret the manner in which modern developments have been perceived by economists. Thus, as my title indicates, this is an essay in the history of economic thought, not in economic history. But it would be disingenuous not to admit to a more pointed purpose of my investigation. It is to inquire into the successes and failures of economic thought in anticipating the march of actual events.

100487,1990,journal of economic perspectives,government failures in development,government failures in development,"This review of the development of national-level evaluation of Government policies and programs for eight European and North American countries illustrates two important points; one deliberate, the other, perhaps, accidental, but frankly admitted by the editor. the first is that the status of development of evaluation at the national level is poor and its future uncertain. Driven more by political demands than by an objective review of management needs and facing a climate of suspicion by departmental bureaucrats, advance in the use of this important tool is a matter of one and a half steps forward and one back. The second, which has bedeviled evaluation literature for years, is the enormous range of definitions of evaluation and the widely differing uses of terms such as program and policy evaluations. The editor admits at the outset of his opening chapter that &dquo;phrases like ’program evaluation,’ ’policy analysis,’ ’policy evaluation,’ ’policy studies,’ ’effectiveness audits,’ and ’policy forecasting’ were all used, and often interchangeably.&dquo; He is rightly troubled by the failure of the individual country reviews to resolve these confusions. Far from contributing to such resolution, the reviews cause the reader’s head to spin as these terms and others proliferate page upon page and breed further even more confusing offspring such as &dquo;component evaluation,&dquo; &dquo;evaluability assessment,&dquo; &dquo;policy program evaluation,&dquo; &dquo;evaluation research,&dquo; &dquo;sectoral social-science research,&dquo; &dquo;retrospective policy evaluation,&dquo; and many more. Until evaluation is defined to cover a limited part of the spectrum of analysis of implementation and impact of activities, this confusion will persist. And more than semantics is involved. If evaluation is perceived to include monitoring of progress, supervision of management performance, surveillance by central authorities over the actions of line departments, and auditing of the physical and financial records, it is inevitable that the political and governmental demands of evaluation will be in conflict with the evaluators’ perception of what evaluation should encompass.

100488,1990,journal of economic perspectives,market failure and government failure,market failure and government failure,"F or several decades a debate has been raging in development economics on the relative virtues of the free market as opposed to state intervention. With the help of analytical models of a market economy, the interventionists demonstrate what they consider serious instances of ""market failure""-that is, the inability of a market economy to reach certain desirable outcomes in resource use. The protagonists of free markets, on the other hand, compile impressive lists of ill-conceived and counterproductive policy measures implemented by the governments of different countries at various times, leading to wasteful use of resources in their economies. This debate inevitably remains inlconclusive. The analytical results on "" market failure"" do not disappear in the face of the evidence that most governments (or for that matter most economies of less developed countries, with or without state intervention) have performed rather badly. When there appears to be scope for imnprovement over the market outcome, the search for the appropriate corrective measures goes on. Some protagonists of ""government failure"" question the significance of such market failures; others voice skepticism about the ability of governments to take any action in the economy which is not counterproductive; but none of them seems to be able to explain why a less developed country like India failed to grow during the first half of this century under a non-interventionist colonial adnministration. Thus, while the debate goes on, neither side succeeds in convincing the other. Collapse"

Like many other third world governments, Korea's government has selectively intervened to affect the allocation of resources among industrial activities. It has also used similar policies: taxes and subsidies, credit rationing, various kinds of licensing, and the creation of public enterprises, for example. But these policies have been applied in the context of a radically different development strategy, one of export-led industrialization. Moreover, Korea's economy has experienced exceptionally rapid development with relatively equitable distribution of the gains. This paper argues that the government's selective industrial policies have contributed importantly to Korea's rapid achievement of international competitiveness in a number of industries.' Though accepted by many knowledgeable observers, the conclusion is controversial. It is inherently so owing to insufficient historical information and lack of agreement about the required counterfactual. Reasons for believing that the benefits of selective intervention must have outweighed the costs also are considered. The discussion flags the policy implications of a Schumpeterian approach that views industrialization as a cascade of interlinked technological changes. The implications are no less controversial than is the interpretation of Korean experience. Collapse"

Meyer-Arendt Department of Geology and Geography Mississippi State University Mississippi State, MS 39762 Research on Latin American and Caribbean tourism geography during the 1980s has increased greatly over previous decades. Tourism research is an interdisciplinary field of study, and research opportunities for geographers abound. Of the various academic and applied fields that have contributed to the great increase in tourism research, geographers have contributed a greater than proportional share. Of eleven major categories of research identified among the 1980s publications, which include geographic as well as related non-geographic sources, the most popular ones for geographers are tourism development, descriptive studies and historical studies. Tourism impact studies are also quite popular, not only in terms of general impacts but also specifically environmental impacts, economic impacts and socio-cultural impacts. A high proportion of the publications are on specific impacts, economic impacts and socio-cultural impacts. A high proportion of the publications on specific impacts were supplied by scholars in respective related fields. Also, a total of fourteen theses and dissertations were written on Latin American and Caribbean tourism topics, almost half in Canadian departments of geography. In terms of geographic distribution of the research foci of tourism studies in the 1980s, a map of Latin America exhibits dense clusters in Mexico and at several Caribbean island destinations and vast empty spaces across the South American continent. This pattern may reflect several important points: 1) few researchers are providing a large number of the publications; 2) tourism research is concentrated where English is the native language; 3 the distance-decay principle may keep most North American scholars closer to home; and 4) few Latin American/Caribbean geographers have examined their local tourism industries. In spite of tremendous increases having been made in the number of geographic and related non-geographic publications on Latin American and Caribbean tourism, the increases have been location-specific. The spectrum of research, ranging from explanatory to descriptive to predictive, is encouraging but the geographic applications of that research need to be greatly expanded throughout the Latin American realm. Perhaps these goals will yet be realized before this decade ends. INTRODUCTION In spite of world overpopulation, food shortages, war, and economic recessions, international tourism has become one of the prime revenue generators in the world today. The size of the tourism industry, whether measured by tourist arrivals, revenues derived from tourism, or employment in the tourism sector, steadily continues to expand. Tourism bas already become the primary ""export"" of many lesser-developed countries including several in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 1986, the World Tourism Organi:zation (WTO) estimated receipts from international tourism at 115 billion United States dollars (Pearce 1989). Latin America's share has been estimated at over 10 percent of the world total (Bar-On 1989). As tourism increases year by year, both in the world as well as in Latin America, there is an increasing need to fill research gaps. Knowledge is needed about: 1) the tourist destinations and their historical evolution as such; 2) the movement of tourists to and from and also between destinations; 3) the impacts of tourism, not just in general terms but specifically in terms of economic impacts, socio-cultural impacts, and environmental impacts; and 4) proper guidelines for tourist infrastructure development. Because of the nature of the tourism industry, replete with geographic themes such as population flows/spatial connectivity, perceptions of places, landscape change, environmental impacts, preservation/conservation/management and planning, geographers are well-positioned to help fill the research gaps in tourism studies. Ten years ago, Mings (1981) observed that in spite of rapid growth in the world tourism industry throughout the 1970s, a corollary expansion in tourism research was not evident. For the 1980s, the rate of correlation between tourism and tourism studies has improved, and much literature has become incorporated into the interdisciplinary body of tourism research. Geography has been well represented among the contributing Benchmark 1990, Conference of Latin Americanist Geographers, Vol. 17/18, p. 199 o Copyright 1992, Conference of Latin Americanist Geographers 199 academic disciplines such as anthropology, economics, history, sociology and political science as well as supporting applied fields such as business, hotel/motel management and leisure studies. In spite of tremendous strides having been made in filling research gaps during the past decade, particularly within the realm of geographic research, a review of available publications reveals a continued deficit of knowledge about the patterns, dynamics and impacts of tourism. PURPOSE This paper represents an effort to summariz.e the contributions made to research in tourism geography in Latin America and the Caribbean during the decade of the 1980s. Previous benchmark papers presented at the 1970 and 1980 Conference of Latin Americanist Geographers meetings summariz.ed tourism research from all academic disciplines as well as from government and consulting sources. In view of both the increase in the volume of geographic literature on tourism and also the specific preoccupation with geography, and perhaps also ancillary subfields from related disciplines, this benchmark paper intends to summariz.e geographic publications and a limited amount of related non-geographic literature. This latter category was subjectively evaluated with regard to its extent of overlap with the field of geography and interest of geographers. MEIBODOLOGY As a starting point in the compilation of bibliographic references, monthly issues of Current Geographical Publications were scanned under the ""Tourism,"" ""Recreation"" and ""Latin America"" headings, as were several chapters in the recent landmark volume on Geography in America (Gaile and Wilmott 1989). The Annals of Tourism Research, the pre-eminent quarterly devoted to social science aspects of tourism, was perused to cull articles and also to inspect the contents of the other major tourism journals which were, until last year, published at the end of the journal. The Proceedings and Yearbooks of the Conference of Latin Americanist Geographers were also examined, as was the American Geographical Society's Focus magazine. This is America's equivalent of the Geographical Magazine, which publishes a high proportion of tourism-related articles. Even the popular National Geographic Magazine was examined to see if tourism studies were highlighted. Also, to determine the extent of Latin American tourism research conducted at the Master's and Ph.D. levels, the Guide to Departments of Geography in the United States and Canada, Dissertation Abstracts International, and a summary article on Ph.D.-level tourism studies (Jafari and Aaser 1988) were examined. Excluded from the survey were: 1) papers presented at professio~ meetings, many of which were not very professional and therefore unpublishable; 2) clear non-geography references, which ranged from descriptive pieces in popular publications to highly-statistical input-output economic analyses; and 3) various tourist industry reports provided by individual countries, international organizations and private consulting firms. Mings (1981) made reference to numerous country-wide tourism baseline studies, market analyses, economic analyses and planning documents, but the extent of geographers' inputs was not made explicit. United States tourism consulting firms such as Davidson-Peterson Associates, Inc. of Maine have conducted numerous tourism studies for various Latin American and Caribbean nations, but most of these remain proprietary (T. L. Davidson, personal communication 1990). Tourism reports by inter-regional and international organizations such as the Organization of American States (OAS) and various branches of the United Nations, including the United Nations Environmental Programme, were omitted because of limited circulation and because these often comprise baseline data compilations rather than geographic analyses. The International Geographical Union (IGU) has several working groups investigating world tourism and its impacts and several projects are underway for the 1992 meetings. Past IGU publications did not appear in the Current Geographical Publications, however, and time constraints precluded an extensive international bibliographic search. THEMES IN LATIN AMERICAN TOURISM RESEARCH The literature search yielded a total of 95 references. Of this total, 50 citations were publications by geographers, 17 were theses and dissertations in geography, and 28 were publications by non-geographers and from nongeography journals but on topics related to research interests of tourism geographers. Although comparison with the earlier benchmark papers is difficult because of different sets of data analyz.ed, the 50 publications by geographers on Latin America tourism in the 1980s (not including theses and dissertations) greatly exceed the 8 Collapse"

These striking conclusions warrant further exploration. Unfortunately, industrial organization textbooks still discuss horizontal cooperation and competition almost exclusively in terms of standard cartel theory. (On the other hand, vertical cooperation/contracting is viewed differently, and some textbooks provide treatments of supplier-buyer relationships in which cooperation is viewed as enhancing efficiency.) Both in the textbooks and in policy discussion among economists, cooperation among competitors is highly suspect, being perhaps the last bastion of what was once referred to as the ""inhospitality tradition"" in antitrust. As a result, very little literature addresses how cooperation among competitors can promote competition, notwithstanding that cooperation among competitors may sometimes be essential if innovating firms are to compete in today's increasingly global markets (Imai and Baba, 1989). Such cooperation is already important in Japan and in Europe. 1 Collapse"
100492,1990,journal of economic perspectives,antitrust law and innovation cooperation,antitrust law and innovation cooperation,"The issue posed by the Jorde-Teece paper and by several bills proposed in Congress is whether the antitrust laws should be modified to promote collaboration in innovation between business firms, especially in high technology industries. Jorde and Teece and other proponents of such legislation argue that in the arena of world competition, the United States cannot afford to have antitrust laws that are more restrictive of innovation collaboration than the laws of Europe and Japan. They argue that since there is very little risk of cartelization in rapidly evolving high technology industries, the benefits from permissive antitrust can be achieved at virtually no cost. My own analysis will conclude that innovation collaboration, particularly when it encompasses production and marketing, can create anticompetitive risks, and should be subject to the antitrust laws. It appears unlikely that actual antitrust enforcement inhibits technological collaboration in any direct way because government enforcement is extremely permissive and no successful private cases have been brought in recent years. To the extent that misguided perceptions of antitrust risk may have discouraged some types of innovation collaboration, a few narrowly targeted reforms are sufficient to correct the problem.

One is that of a normative theory — that is, the elaboration of a theoretical blueprint for an economy, relying upon both the plan and the market. Whatever might be the significance of such an approach, this paper takes as its basic themes the other approach, namely positive analysis. A reform process is under way in several socialist countries. The course of thought applied in the paper is based on the hypothesis that in all reform countries it is possible to identify certain common tendencies. Of course, each reforming country constitutes a unique case, and one must look hard to find suitable ways of discerning common patterns of reform in countries as diverse as Yugoslavia, Hungary, China, Poland and the USSR. One must accomplish another equally difficult task as well, that is the task of properly evaluating the cases of failed reform such as the one which was attempted in 1968 in Czechoslovakia. Nevertheless, there exist many common lessons, and in this paper we will attempt to delineate some of them. Collapse"

100499,1990,journal of economic perspectives,tax credits for low-income workers with children,tax credits for low income workers with children,"Understanding the causes of the rise in disability rolls lies at the heart of policies concerned with the interaction of working life, family well-being, and a country’s social safety net. To explore the long-run drivers of disability insurance (DI) receipt, we use administrative tax data that allows us to link young adults (ages 24-34) to their parents. Our findings are threefold. First, DI receipt is strongly linked to the income of the recipient’s parents, with rates for young adults from the poorest families roughly six times higher than those from the richest families. Second, children from low income families display sharply varying probabilities of receiving DI depending on the place where they grew up, while those from rich families show no similar differences. Suggestive evidence indicates that roughly 50% of these place-based differences are causal. Third, places where poor children grow up to have the highest rates of DI receipt tend to be “good” areas based on many standard characteristics, including lower inequality, lower segregation, higher school quality, and higher social capital. 1. Background and Literature A striking pattern over the past few decades is the large and steady rise in participation rates in various sickness and disability related programs. Of particular interest is the rise in disability insurance (DI) receipt. This is in part because DI is the largest social insurance program in most industrialized countries, but also because it is usually an absorbing state: few individuals who go onto DI re-enter the work force at a later date. For example, over the past 50 years DI rolls have steadily risen from less than 1% to 6% 1 This research was supported by the U.S. Social Security Administration through grant #1 DRC1200000204 to the National Bureau of Economic Research as part of the SSA Disability Research Consortium. The findings and conclusions expressed are solely those of the author(s) and do not represent the views of SSA, the U.S. Department of Treasury, any other agency of the Federal Government, or the NBER. of the adult population in the U.S. (Autor and Duggan, 2006, Burkhauser and Daly, 2012). Prominent researchers have argued that such rises in disability insurance rolls are fiscally unsustainable (Autor and Duggan, 2006), especially as current DI recipients are younger and have longer life expectancies on average compared to previous cohorts of recipients. Understanding the causes of the rise in disability rolls lies at the heart of policies concerned with the interaction of working life, family well-being, and a country’s social safety net. To date, research has largely focused on describing non-medical factors correlated with the probability of claiming disability benefits, such as economic conditions, local allowance rates, and age. For instance, DI applications and awards spike during recessions and fall off during boom years (Black, Daniel and Sanders 2002, Autor and Duggan 2003), a pattern that held strongly as DI applications rose during the Great Recession (Mueller, Rothstein and von Wachter 2015). Less educated workers and older workers are also more likely to claim disability benefits (SSA 2014). There is also considerable variation in disability receipt across areas related to compositional differences in the population with respect to age, education, and industrial structure (Ruffing 2015). While this research has been important in describing certain correlates of DI receipt, it has been limited in its ability to look at long-term factors that shift an individual’s chances of DI receipt. Another limitation is that only a few existing studies try to distinguish between selection and causation in the factors that predict DI receipt. Sorting out these scenarios is central to understand how economic conditions or government policies may affect disability rolls. In this paper, we try to address these limitations, making two key contributions. First, we use U.S. administrative tax data to link young adults to their parents, and carefully describe the long-term predictors of DI receipt. In particular, the size and detailed nature of the data we are using allows us to describe the relationship between parents’ income and the probability that the child participates in DI as young 2 This trend is not specific to the U.S., as documented by OECD (2010). In the U.K., for example, DI rolls have steadily risen from 1% to 7% over the past 50 years. 3 A notable exception is Dahl et al. (2014). They take advantage of random assignment of judges to DI applicant to show that DI receipt in one generation is causing DI participation in the next generation. adult. Using our rich data, we characterize how these intergenerational relationships vary across areas within the U.S. The geographic variation in the association between parents’ income and children’s DI participation could be driven by two very different sources. One possibility is that neighborhoods have causal effects on the chances an individual claims DI: that is, moving a given child to a different neighborhood would change her likelihood of participating in DI. Another possibility is that the observed geographic variation is due to systematic differences in the types of people living in each area, such as differences in demographic makeup or wealth. The second contribution of our paper is to test these explanations and identify the causal effects of neighborhoods by studying families who move across counties and exploiting differences in their children’s ages when they move. This strategy has previously been used by Chetty and Hendren (2015) to study intergenerational income mobility. 2. Data Our dataset is the universe of IRS administrative tax data from 1996-2014. Our sample of potential DI claimants includes those born in the 1980-1990 cohorts. We measure DI receipt for young adults (ages 24-34) through the receipt of Form 1099-SSA, which the SSA files with the IRS for all DI payments. (Our data do not include SSI payments.) We cannot distinguish disabled workers from other claiming benefits (spouses, adult children, or dependents), but for individuals receiving SSDI payments at ages 24-34, just 2% of program recipients are spouses and dependents would be ineligible. Adult children are a greater concern, but our approach to study hazard rates (rather than the stock of DI recipients) minimizes this concern, since most adult children begin to receive benefits before age 24. We then link young adults to their parents by finding the household that claims each child as a dependent for tax purposes. This procedure is especially effective for lowincome children, whose parents often receive large tax credits as a result of filing; 4 Raj Chetty and John N. Friedman accessed these data under contract TIRNO-16-E-00013 with Statistics of Income (SOI) Division of IRS. altogether, previous work in these data has linked 95% of all children to a household in this way (Chetty et al. 2014). We measure household income for the parents using adjusted gross income (AGI) from income tax returns, imputing this income from various information returns (including W-2s, 1099-SSA, and 1099-UI) for non-filers, using data from 1996-2000 (which is the earliest that we can observe parental income). We then rank parents’ income against other households with children in the same cohort; this within-cohort ranking helps adjust for differences in the age of income measurement or in the calendar years at which income is measured. While these households may not include a child’s biological parents, they do represent circumstances in which the child grew up (to simplify language we refer to such households as “parents”). We drop young adults whom we cannot link to their parents in this way. Including all 11 cohorts, this leaves us with a sample of 38.4 million young adults and 222.4 million individual-year observations. Table I presents summary statistics for the key variables in our analysis. In Panel A, we present data at age 24, the only year when we have data for all 11 of our cohorts. The average DI rate in the full sample is 0.66%. Panel B presents the same statistics at age 34 (for cohort 1980 only). At that age, 2.0% of individuals receive SSDI payments. It is also worth noting that 2.5% of individuals at age 34 have received SSDI income at some point since age 24; thus, 20% of individuals ever receiving income from the program have left. This reflects (as least in part) a somewhat larger recovery rate for young adults; the comparable rate for disabled beneficiaries on average across the entire program is substantially lower. It is also possible that changing relationship to a beneficiary (e.g., divorced spouse) accounts for some of this, but the preponderance of disabled workers among beneficiaries at these ages implies that this should be a relatively small share of those leaving the program. We can also calculate, for each individual in each year, whether they are covered by the SSDI program. SSA rules mandate that individuals work a minimum number of quarters of coverage (QCs) before applying to DI, where a worker earns one QC for each $1,260 (in 2016) of covered earnings up to a maximum of four QCs per year. (Despite the label “quarters,” it does not actually matter when in the year workers earn this income; for example, a worker may earn all four credits in January even if she does not work in any other month.) For each worker in each year, we calculate the number of QCs earned by dividing the sum of Social Security Wages (W-2, Box 3) and Net SelfEmployment Income (Schedule SE, Box 4 (Short Schedule) or Box 6 (Long Schedule)) by the annual QC amount. We then compare an individual’s accrued QCs to the minimum number required for eligibility. This minimum varies by age; individuals must have accumulated a minimum of 2*(Age – 21) QCs since the time they were 21 years old. For instance, a 27-year-old must have earned at least 12 QCs after turn Collapse"

Although signaling models have been used to explain the price reaction of these announcements, a usual assumption made in these models is that insiders cannot trade to gain from such announcements. An innovative feature of this paper is to model trading by corporate insiders (subject to disclosure regulation) as one of the signals. Detailed testable predictions are described for the interaction of corporate announcements and concurrent insider trading. In particular, such interaction is shown to depend crucially on whether the firm is a growth firm, a mature firm, or a declining firm. Empirical proxies for firm technology are developed based on measures of growth and Tobin's q ratio. In the underlying ""efficient"" signaling equilibrium, investment announcements and net insider trading convey private information of insiders to the market at least cost. The paper also addresses issues of deriving intertemporal announcement effects from the equilibrium (cross-sectional) pricing functional. Other announcement effects relate the intensity of the market response to insider trading, variance of firm cash flows, risk aversion of the insiders, and characteristics of firm technology (growth, mature, or declining).

The constant depends only on average risk tolerance across investors. The same constant applies to every real foreign investment held by every investor. Foreign investors are those with different consumption goods, not necessarily those who live in different countries. In equilibrium, the price of the world market portfolio will adjust so that the constant will be related to an average of world market risk premia, an average of world market volatilities, and an average of exchange rate volatilities, where we take the averages over all investors. The constant will not be related to exchange rate means or covariances. In the limiting case when exchange risk approaches zero, the constant will be equal to one minus the ratio of the variance of the world market return to its mean.

100561,1990,journal of finance,default risk in futures markets: the customer-broker relationship,default risk in futures markets  the customer broker relationship,"The traditional view of the futures clearinghouse as an insurer that eliminates the need for customers to evaluate default risk is inaccurate. A clearinghouse member default in 1985 confirms that the clearinghouse only guarantees payment from member to member, not from customer to customer or member to customer. Thus, non-defaulting customers are subject to losses as a result of the action of individuals with whom thay have no contractual obligations. This study models the behavior of customers choosing a futures commission merchant (FCM) given the current legal position of the clearinghouse. In a single-period model with symmetric information, customers can eliminate their exposure to defaults of other customers or of their FCM only by choosing to trade through ""boutique"" (undiversified) FCMs. In practice, monitoring and rebalancing costs may impede the attainment of zero default risk. However, FCM diversification remains an important factor in customer choice of an FCM. When setting capital requirements, clearinghouses and government regulators need to consider the implications of diversification for both customer and market protection. FUTURES MARKETS PROVIDE A well-recognized service to the economy by allowing for broader access to the means for reducing risk. Futures markets are distinguished from forward markets largely by the role played by the clearinghouse and its members. The clearinghouse has been viewed by Telser and Higinbotham (1977), Black (1976), Edwards (1983), and others as providing an important ""insurance"" function. Each trader need not worry about the risk of default by the other side of the contract because the clearinghouse presumably plays the short for every long and long for every short. Traders need only be concerned about the ability of the clearinghouse to live up to the terms on the futures contract. One feature believed to enhance confidence in the clearinghouse is the requirement that margin be posted at the clearinghouse by each side of the contract (see Telser (1981), Garbade and Silber (1983), and Brennan (1986)). Given daily resettlement on futures contracts, if one side of the contract defaults, the clearinghouse can close the position and use the margin to satisfy the other side of the contract. In practice, the clearinghouse requires only that the broker, or futures commission merchant (FCM), post the margin and, within some constraints, leaves the FCM to set requirements with its own customers.

In this paper we test this structural change hypothesis with savings and loan data. We find support for the hypothesis that separable, constant returns to scale production functions characterize the average savings and loan in our sample in 1983. This is in contrast to the cost complementarities found in 1978. We argue that this result may be the result of regulatory changes that allowed savings and loans to alter their production mix to fully capture the benefits of joint production. IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO assume that the cost minimizing configuration of a multiproduct firm is potentially subject to nonstationarity during periods of structural change in input and/or output markets. The late 1970s and early 1980s represent such a period of turbulence for many markets in the financial services industry. Volatile interest rates, combined with technological and regulatory changes, may have caused firms in this industry to alter their output mixes in an effort to capture cost complementarities from joint production. The purpose of this paper is to test this hypothesis of structural change in the savings and loan industry using both a translog and minflex Laurent translog (MLT) specification of the production function. We have chosen to investigate savings and loans (S&Ls) during the late 1970s and early 1980s for two reasons. First, S&Ls provide an ideal vehicle for testing our hypothesis because they were restricted almost exclusively to mortgages and securities as outputs before the passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 and the Garn-St. Germain Act of 1982. Moreover, there were also market changes with respect to both the pricing and mix of inputs (i.e., deposits). Our second rationale involves the fact that there is a large and growing body of literature in the area of what is now called the Collapse"

The noise increases return variances and adds negative serial correlation to return series. Standard variance and serial covariance estimators therefore overestimate the variance and serial covariance of the underlying stock values. Discreteness-induced variance and serial covariance depend on underlying volatility and on the size of the bid/ask spread. Simple formulas for approximating the effects of discreteness on variance and serial correlation are derived and presented. The approximations, which are accurate in daily data, can be used to adjust the standard variance and serial covariance estimators. Collapse"

Observable instruments measuring the term structure of interest rates, levels of bond and stock prices, and a January dummy are found to predict excess returns on corporate bonds. An intertemporal asset pricing model with changing expectations and unobservable factors is then estimated for the predictable excess returns using Hansen's Generalized Method of Moments. The results show that a multibeta linear time-varying model of con? ditional expected returns with constant betas can successfully value corporate bonds. Spe? cifically, the tests indicate the presence of two time-varying hedge portfolios. The data, however, support a single latent variable specification when all January observations are excluded. This result suggests the existence of a strong January seasonal in one of the latent variables. Collapse"

It examines the effect of heterogeneous investment horizons on the functional form of capital asset pricing and proposes a translog model for estimating the risk-return relationship. In addition, this paper contends that some empirical findings that are inconsistent with the traditional CAPM have resulted from misspecification of the CAPM by ignoring the discrepancy between the observed data periods and the true investment horizons. Finally, the paper shows that under various conditions, the translog model is a suitable function for estimating the relationship between risk and expected returns. Collapse"

100622,1990,journal of human resources,assessing empirical approaches for analyzing taxes and labor supply,assessing empirical approaches for analyzing taxes and labor supply,"Recent surveys on the labor-supply responses of men document a divergence in the estimates of substitution and income effects obtained using various estimation approaches. Generally, studies accounting for nonlinear tax schedules in a static setting via a piecewise-linear approach produce estimates that typically imply higher substitution and lower income responses than are suggested by empirical work applying other approaches. This paper demonstrates that maximum likelihood estimation of a consumer-choice problem with nonlinear budget sets implicitly relies on the satisfaction of inequality constraints that translate into behaviorally meaningful restrictions. These constraints arise not as a consequence of economic theory, but instead as a requirement to create a properly defined statistical model. In the analysis of piecewise-linear budget sets, the implicit constraints required by maximum likelihood in estimation amount to imposition of Slutsky conditions at all wage-income combinations associated with kink points. In the analysis of differentiable budget sets, the tacit constraints invoked by maximum likelihood also involve inequality restrictions on Slutsky terms. The empirical work presented in this study supports the contention that these implicit constraints play a major role in explaining the discrepancies in estimates found in the literature on men's labor supply.

100624,1990,journal of human resources,"labor supply, income taxes, and hours restrictions in the netherlands",labor supply income taxes and hours restrictions in the netherlands,"In this paper, two models of individual labor supply are discussed. The first one is the by now classical Hausman-type model with convex piecewise linear budget constraints, in which both random preferences and optimization errors are incorporated by means of normally distributed random variables. Estimated coefficients are plausible but the model has the shortcoming that unemployment for males is not captured and that the simulated hours distribution misses the spikes in the sample distribution of working hours. Therefore, an alternative model is introduced which explicitly takes into account demand side restrictions on working hours. The difference with the standard model is the replacement of the optimization error by the assumption that each individual can choose from a finite set of wage hours packages and either picks the job offer yielding highest utility or decides not to work. It turns out that this model captures the sample distribution of working hours very well, for males as well as females. Wage and income elasticities according to the two models are similar and in line with other recent findings in The Netherlands. Dead weight loss calculations for the second model which explicitly take the hours restrictions into account, imply that the dead weight loss is much smaller than as calculated with the standard model.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)

I focus on moral hazard (a brief discussion in the Appendix shows that the results are unchanged by private information). There is symmetric information prior to contracting, but those who buy claims against the firm's assets cannot directly and costlessly control the firm's actions that affect the productivity of these assets. This moral hazard affects asset valuation (see also Ramakrishnan and Thakor). The fact that informational problems are intricately linked to how firms are internally organized is now widely accepted (see, for example, Holmstrom, 1988, and Williamson, 1967, 1970). Moreover, lolmnstrom (1988) and Sah and Stiglitz also make the point that real investment activity is influenced by how investment decisions are internally organized within firms.

The basic setup is a two-stage version of a vertical integration problem. In stage one, the upstream and downstream managers, respectively, expend costreducing and revenue-enhancing effort. In the second stage, managers observe private information about upstream costs and downstream revenues, and a quantity decision is made. This paper focuses on the ex ante choice between long-term contracts and firms, before specific investment. The central contribution is to provide a simple, testable theory of the implicit efficiency tradeoffs between long-term contracts and firms. ""Longterm contracts"" are defined as arrangements where parties prespecify a nonlinear (transfer) pricing schedule before investment in specific assets. One firm then sets output, and each manager is compensated out of the residual earnings of the portion of production they manage.

Time enters the cost of shopping in a number of different ways, perhaps most directly by diverting from other activities the time needed to plan purchases, search for selection, travel to store locations, and queue for service. Because the time spent shopping is often independent of the quantity of goods purchased, households economize by choosing to shop discretely through time. An optimal shopping frequency is chosen by trading off the falling (per unit time) cost of postponing a shopping trip with the rising cost of holding higher levels of inventories. While time costs may be independent of the quantities purchased, the time spent shopping is not independent of the store's location. Reducing the distance between a household and its shopping area reduces directly the time spent in each trip and lowers the cost of the optimal plan. Indirectly, the time spent shopping can be reduced by combining shopping with other activities (e.g., dropping the laundry off on the way to work or buying milk on the way home from a party). The household's ability to take advantage of the particularities of time and place is a function of the length of time that Collapse"

Considering the first of these, legal errors necessarily result from imperfect information on the part of courts and are generally of two types: incorrect conviction of innocent defendants (type I errors), and incorrect acquittal of guilty defendants (type II errors). Both are assumed to impose some cost on society. On the other hand, society presumably gains from correctly punishing the truly guilty. One reason, of course, is deterrence, although I abstract from this motive here. Additionally, however, I assume that society benefits by matching the punishment of criminals to the crime they have committed (one might call this ""retribution"").2 By the appropriate choice of the variables of the legal process-namely, prosecutorial effort in collecting evi- Collapse"

100776,1990,journal of policy analysis and management,introduction to symposium on managing local development,introduction to symposium on managing local development,"INTRODUCIION Economic development has become one of the major public policies emphasized by state, county, and city governments for the last two decades (e.g., Eisinger, 1988; Levy, 1990; Luke et al., 1988; McGowan and Ottensmeyer, 1993). The importance of economic development for these governments has to do with changes in both the domestic and international economic and political environments. Domestically, for example, the turbulence of the national economy in the 1970s, the recessions of the early 1980s, the rise of federal budget deficits, and the cutback of federal aid to the states have forced state and local governments to broaden their efforts in economic development. Internationally, the globalization of the world economy, especially the increasing role of foreign trade and investment in the United States, has forced many state (and some large city) governments to become actively involved in international economic activities (e.g., Kline, 1983; Liou, 1993). To promote economic development, public managers and policymakers have developed and implemented various policies and programs to attract and retain businesses (i.e., the third wave of state and local economic development policy). The policies and programs emphasized range from reducing the cost of doing business (e.g., production costs, direct loans, industrial parks, job training, tax abatements) to increasing services for business operation (e.g., RD Eisinger, 1988; Luke et al., 1988). The effectiveness of these policies and programs has been empirically tested and generally supported in the literature of state and local economic development (Bartik, 1991). State and local government officials have recently emphasized the use of strategic planning as one of the key managerial techniques not only to coordinate economic development activities but also to accommodate economic changes (e.g., Allen and Plosila, 1988; Mier, Moe, and Sherr, 1986; Reed and Blair, 1993; Reed, Reed, and Luke, 1987). The linkage between strategic planning and economic development provides an unique opportunity for researchers of public management and policy to examine concepts and issues related to strategic planning and economic development and to make a contribution to the literature of both disciplines. For strategic planning researchers, the linkage between the two will help them understand the application of strategic planning in the public management and policy arenas. For economic development researchers, the linkage will give them more knowledge about critical issues related to economic development, planning, and management functions. The purpose of this symposium is to examine the relationship between strategic planning and economic development. This introduction article will first offer explanations about some critical concepts that are related to strategic planning and economic development. Next, this article will summarize major issues and findings of the symposium articles. CRITICAL CONCEPTS Economic development has been defined or referred to as different goals or objectives for various governments under different conditions. At the national level, for example, the objective of economic development policy for developed countries is to increase their economic growth, usually measured by such output or income as gross national product (GNP) or gross domestic product (GDP). This objective is different from that of the developing countries. For those countries, the objective of their economic development policy refers not only to increase in the growth rate of GNP or GDP but also to changes in their economic, social, and political structures (Goode, 1984). Locally-based economic development has been explained as ""a process by which local government and/or community-based groups manage their existing resources and enter into new partnership arrangements with the private sector, or with each other, to create new jobs and stimulate economic activities in a well-defined economic zone"" (Blakely, 1989:58). … Collapse"

Content analysis and time-series techniques are used to estimate the Church's response to social change and the effect that this response has had upon member commitment and rates of conversionfrom 1950 to 1986. Wefind that despite initial resistance in the late 1960s and 1970s the Church has been moving to accommodate change in women's roles. Accommodation appears to increase participation among younger and less experienced members but decrease participation among older and more experienced members, suggesting that a successful church must strike a balance between accommodation and resistance to social change. How do churches respond to changes that threaten the social underp gs of their beliefs? Such changes are pervasive in the modem world: Catholicism confronts new contraceptive technologies and acceptability of divorce; Evangelical denominations must come to terms with evolutionary science; Mormonism must deal with changing family structures. As these examples suggest, the problems created by change are not easily resolved. Intransigence puts a church increasingly at odds with the prevailing culture and risks alienating both current members and potential converts; accommodation undermines its claim to transcendent truth and divine authority. In this article, we develop a rational-choice model of church behavior that identifies the trade-offs imposed by change and demonstrates its tendency to polarize church membership. We then test this model by measuring the Mormon Church's response to change in the roles of American women. Using time-series techniques, we estimate the Mormon Church's response to social change and, in turn, the effect this response has had upon member commitment and rates of growth from 1950 to 1986.

The Inevitable Dilemma When social or technological change reduces the perceived value of an organization's outputs, continued success requires a response. But whereas a business firm's optimal response usually entails embracing the new environment, a church's ""optimal"" response is less clear-cut. Churches confront an ""inevitable dilemma"" (Yinger 1946). They must respond to the wishes of their members, lest they lose support (Brannon 1971), but they must also make distinctive demands, lest they lose credibility. Churches exist in part because they offer an alternative to societal norms (Hunter 1983; Lee 1960; Neal 1971). Hence, a church that loses its distinctiveness also loses its appeal. A Soviet Molokan sect studied by Lane (1975) illustrates this principle. Committed to a communitarian lifestyle, this sect approved of communist government before the Russian Revolution and was in tum tolerated after the Communists took power. Yet, as the sect gained government acceptance, it lost both members and commitment. In contrast, a radical Molokan splinter group that opposed the Communist govenmment grew. The development of American Protestant denominations likewise illustrates the need for continuing distinctiveness. For more than a generation American Protestantism has seen its culturally accommodated liberal wing decline as its sectarian, conservative wing has grown (Finke & Stark 1989). Noting the near-perfect correlation between cultural accommodation and membership decline, Roof and McKinney (1987:21) recently observed that ""almost all of the churches that retained distance from the culture by encouraging distinctive life-styles and beliefs grew; those most immersed in the culture and only vaguely identifiable in terms of their own features suffered declines"" (c.f., Hoge & Roozen 1979; Kelley 1972).1 The preceding examples show that churches often pay a price for accommodation. But it is also true that churches can be hurt by intransigence. When the Pope officially and decisively reiterated the Catholic Church's traditional ban on contraception in the Humanae Vitae encyclical, he shocked and disappointed the great majority of American Catholics and set into motion a backlash that is said to have dramatically reduced American Catholic church attendance, contributions, and confidence in papal authority (Greeley 1985; Greeley, McCready & McCourt 1976; Greeley & McManus 1987; Hout & Greeley 1987). The simultaneous losses of Catholicism on the one hand and liberal Protestantism on the other highlight the dilemma posed by social change. A Cost/ Benefit Model of Church Response to Social Change The problems identffied above can be analyzed with a cost-benefit model of religious organizations.2 In this model, the rewards a member obtains for adhering to her church's demands (and the sanctions she suffers for rejecting them) are summarized by a mathematical relation that economists call a ""production function."" One such function, R, is depicted by the solid line in Figure 1. A person's conduct is represented as a point on the horizontal axis. The height of the hill lying atop this axis indexes the rewards associated with various manners of conduct.

The program led to a proliferation of smaller refineries between 1973 and 1981. When the program ended in 1981, 110 of 282 refineries closed, but capacity fell by only 11 percent. A logit model of the industry shake-out is presented.

This evidence supplements our earlier findings (Bordo and Jonung, Cambridge University Press, 1987) for annual data ending in the early 1970's. We present eVidence that several proxies for institutional change in the financial sector are significant determinants of the long-run velocity function; that for the majority of countries the long-run velocity function incorporating institutional determinants has not undergone significant change over the last 10 to 15 years; and that out of sample forecasts over the last 10 to 15 years based on our institutional hypothesis are superior to those based on a benchmark long-run velocity function for a number of countries. these results suggests that failure to account for institutional change in the financial sector such as may be captured by our proxy variables may well be one factor behind the recently documented instability and decline in predictive power of short-run velocity models incorporating dynamic adjustment and higher frequency data.

More specifically , money's two functions of medium of account and medium of exchange need not be united in a single asset called money .

Assuming target-threshold account monitoring behavior, we examine the issue of aggregate money exogeneity and the role of credit, and other supply side variables. We show that aggregate money can appear exogenous and exhibit slow adjustment to supply shocks in spite of being endogenously and freely generated by the nonmonetary private sector. The mechanism is illustrated by a simulation. One consequence of our analysis is that the short-run money demand function cannot be viewed as a representative agent model, and is conventionally misspecified. We consider instead the system approach based on modeling the supply side, or money counterparts. We illustrate our method by an application to U.K. personal sector broad money holdings, using the Granger-Engle cointegration methodology to estimate the longrun demand schedule.

Applications include advice and involvement, as in quality control circles and committees; production and service, as in assembly groups and sales teams; projects and development, as in engineering and research groups; and action and negotiation, as in sports teams and combat units. An analytic framework depicts team effectiveness as interdependent with organizational context, boundaries, and team development. Key context factors include (a) organizational culture, (b) technology and task design, (c) mission clarity, (d) autonomy, (e) rewards, ( f ) performance feedback, (g) training/consultation, and (h) physical environment. Team boundaries may mediate the impact of organizational context on team development. Current research leaves unanswered questions but suggests that effectiveness depends on organizational context and boundaries as much as on internal processes. Issues are raised for research and practice. The terms work team and work group appear often in today's discussions of organizations. Some experts claim that to be effective modern firms need to use small teams for an increasing variety of jobs. For instance, in an article subtitled ""The Team as Hero,"" Reich (1987) wrote, If we are to compete in today's world, we must begin to celebrate collective entrepreneurship, endeavors in which the whole of the effort is greater than the sum of individual contributions. We need to honor our teams more, our aggressive leaders and maverick geniuses less. (p. 78) Work teams occupy a pivotal role in what has been described as a management transformation (Walton, 1985), paradigm shift (Ketehum, 1984), and corporate renaissance (Kanter, 1983). In this management revolution, Peters (1988) advised that organizations use ""multi-function teams for all development activities"" (p. 210) and ""organize every function into tento thirty-person, largely self-managing teams"" (p. 296). Tornatzky (1986) pointed to new technologies that allow small work groups to take responsibility for whole products. Hackman (1986) predicted that, ""organizations in the future will rely heavily on member self-management"" (p. 90). Building blocks of such organizations are self-regulating work teams. But University of Tennessee University of Wisconsin--Eau Claire University o f Tennessee far from being revolutionary, work groups are traditional; ""the problem before us is not to invent more tools, but to use the ones we have"" (Kanter, 1983, p. 64). In this article, we explore applications of work teams and propose an analytic framework for team effectiveness. Work teams are defined as interdependent collections of individuals who share responsibility for specific outcomes for their organizations. In what follows, we first identify applications of work teams and then offer a framework for analyzing team effectiveness. Its facets make up topics of subsequent sections: organizational context, boundaries, and team development. We close with issues for research and practice. A p p l i c a t i o n s o f W o r k T e a m s Two watershed events called attention to the benefits of applying work teams beyond sports and mih'tary settings: the Hawthorne studies (Homans, 1950) and European experiments with autonomous work groups (Kelly, 1982). Enthusiasm has alternated with disenchantment (Bramel & Friend, 1987), but the 1980s have brought a resurgence of interest. Unfortunately, we have little evidence on how widely work teams are used or whether their use is expanding. Pasmore, Francis, Haldeman, and Shani (1982) reported that introduction of autonomous work groups was the most common intervention in 134 experiments in manufacturing firms. Production teams number among four broad categories of work team applications: (a) advice and involvement, (b) production and service, (c) projects and development, and (d) action and negotiation. Advice and Involvement Decision-making committees traditional in management now are expanding to first-line employees. Quality control (QC) circles and employee involvement groups have been common in the 1980s, often as vehicles for employee participation ( Cole, 1982 ). Perhaps several hundred thousand U.S. employees belong to QC circles (Ledford, Lawler, & Mohrman, 1988), usually first-line manufacturing employees who meet to identify opportunities for improvement. Some make and carry out proposals, but most have restricted scopes of activity and little working time, perhaps a few hours each month (Thompson, 1982). Employee involvement groups operate similarly, exploring ways to improve customer service (Peterfreund, 1982). 120 February 1990 • American Psychologist Copyright 1990 by the American Psyc2aological A~mciafion, Inc. 0003-066X/90/$00.75 Vol. 45, No. 2, 120-133 QC circles and employee involvement groups at times may have been implemented poorly (Shea, 1986), but they have been used extensively in some companies Collapse"
100857,1990,journal of public economics,"housing, taxes, and capital allocation",housing taxes and capital allocation,"In this paper we explore the efficiency gains from the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and prospective tax reforms, separating out the intersectoral and intertemporal efficiency consequences. To assess these effects, we employ a general equilibrium model that considers the effects of taxes on the allocation of capital across industries, assets, sectors, and time. We find that the 1986 tax reform yielded only a small improvement in the intersectoral allocation of capital because the beneficial effects from its more uniform treatment of capital within the business sector are largely offset by adverse effects stemming from increased tax disparities between the business and housing sectors. The intertemporal efficiency effects of the reform, in contrast, are significant and negative. Hence the overall efficiency impact of the reform is negative as well. Our results indicate that the economic margins offering the greatest scope for efficiency gains are different from those that received the most attention under the 1986 tax reform. While much of the 1986 reform concentrated on reducing tax disparities within the business sector, much larger efficiency gains would result from reducing tax disparities between the business and housing sectors and from general reductions in effective marginal tax rates on capital.

As First Executive Corporation had more than 15 billion dollars in assets, its failure provoked increasing debate over the prediction system of financial distress in insurance industry, the Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS). From 1970s, National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has developed IRIS which serves as a baseline solvency screening system. IRIS helps regulators prioritize insurers for detailed financial analysis and allocate their resources according to need by producing 12 financial ratios for life insurers and 11 for property-casualty insurers (Atchinson 1996). When an insurer has four or more of those ratios beyond the specified range, the state regulators and NAIC will classify it as priority firm and pay immediate attention. Two years after failure of First Executive, NAIC adopted the Financial Analysis and Solvency Tracking System (FAST) as an expansion of IRIS. FAST assigns different points for different ranges of 29 financial ratio results. The higher the total score is, the higher attention the state regulators and NAIC pay for. Essentially, IRIS is the implementation of univariate approach of discriminant analysis first proposed by Beaver (1966), and FAST is the implementation of multivariate analysis first proposed by Altman (1968). From 1980s, the logistic analysis has replaced multivariate analysis as a most used statistical method for insolvency prediction purposes, since multivariate analysis suffers from its normality assumption. Except the prediction systems used by NAIC, financial academy and practitioner proposed a number of other methods to predict business insolvency, ranging from nonfinancial industries to financial industries. In the insurance industry, most previous studies have been made on the property & casualty insurers, but very limited of them have been applied to life & health sector. More important, most approaches applied to insurance companies are statistical methods such as discriminant or logit analysis. Both of them suffer from their statistical assumptions about the observed information which is a set of financial ratios in most cases. Recently, the integration of artificial intelligence with the financial economics proposed neural network as a promising alternative for classifying the insolvency financial institutions (Brockett 1994; Tam 1990; Salchengerger 1992; Wilson 1994). In this paper, we used a neural network method in life insurer insolvency prediction. Following (Brockett 1994), we constructed a feed-forward backpropagation three-layer artificial neural network, but we applied this method to life insurers listed in NAIC InfoPro data tape. We also compared the predicating ability of stepwise multivariate linear discriminant analysis, the stepwise multivariate logit analysis, and neural network. Using matched data of solvent and insolvent life insurers in the time period from 1993 to 2001, we showed that a neural network model with feed forward, back propagation algorithm can provide satisfactory insolvency predictive ability compared to the traditional methods. Although the neural network model is promising in the prediction of business insolvency, a lot of jobs are still needed to do in the future. At the end of the paper, we further investigate the convergence condition and the proper repeating time. Collapse"
100928,1990,journal of urban economics,a theory and empirical test of land option pricing,a theory and empirical test of land option pricing,"Abstract Land option contracts are agreements whereby a landowner agrees to sell property at a stipulated exercise price to a potential buyer (developer) within a specified length of time. The option contract gives the developer time to coordinate the expertise of many professionals and obtain zoning changes and financing for the property, if necessary. In most cases the developer must either purchase the option to buy the proposed site or purchase the land outright before knowing whether the development is feasible. The landowner's objective is to choose an exercise price (and hence an option premium) which will ensure that the developer will exercise the land option. In a bid-price model where developers are risk-neutral and landowners are risk-averse, the prediction is that land options are written with a zero or close to zero time premium. This paper is a test of this hypothesis and the results confirm the theoretical model. Collapse"

Land use equilibrium conditions are shown to have a stochastic representation which depends on the distribution of the idiosyncratic tastes over the population of households. A special case in which the multinomial logit model gives the representative household's locational choice probability is derived and examined for a logarithmic utility function. It is shown that the stochastic equilibrium can also be obtained as the solution of a welfare optimum problem, either by maximizing total social welfare (primal) or by minimizing total opportunity cost (dual). Either formulation gives the equilibrium allocations and associated decentralizing land prices. Some comparative statics analysis is undertaken to show that while most results are like those of the Alonso-Mills-Muth model, increasing taste heterogeneity decentralizes the linear urban form, “flattening” the rent and population density gradients. The Alonso-Mills-Muth solution is obtained as an asymptotically limiting case which provides an upper bound on the “steepness” of the rent and population density gradients and a lower bound on the length of the linear city and the welfare level of the representative consumer.

After decades of publications investigating male-female earnings differences, economists have formed a consensus that human capital variables—like education, work experience and skills—explain more and discrimination explains less of the gender income gap than the public thinks. Despite the public’s common sense understanding that career success is influenced by noncognitive skills, such as confidence, motivation, and assertiveness, and by work/life preferences, economists cannot offer a consensus judgment regarding the wage gap effect of either. The human capital model of Becker (1964) predicted earnings differences to arise from differences in the broad array of individual abilities and in educational investments. Due to the ease of using cognitive test scores and the difficulty of empirically operationalizing personality traits and noncognitive characteristics, to date empirical analyses have used cognitive test scores to proxy for “individual ability.” Social scientists, able to typically account for only half of the gender pay gap with human capital models based on nationally representative data sets, have long hypothesized that gender heterogeneity may characterize noncognitive skills and a variety of work/life preferences, both of which cause wage differences. Now a burgeoning literature, especially by those conducting lab and field experiments, reports gender heterogeneity of preferences and noncognitive skills (Croson and Gneezy 2009; Booth 2009). Economists and others, though, are just beginning to test the labor market outcomes of such gendered work-life choices and personality traits. Using an especially rich national data set, the twin goals of this paper are (1) to identify noncognitive and preference sources of otherwise unobserved gender heterogeneity and then (2) to estimate whether such heterogeneity accounts for more of the male-female earnings gaps than can be explained by an extensive set of human capital variables. We view our analysis, then, as part of a broad agenda to enrich 2. Although the unexplained component of the gender wage gap is often attributed to discrimination, it also may result from a misspecification of the relationships or from unobserved gender heterogeneity (Polachek and Kim 1994; Altonji and Blank 1999). Regarding discriminatory behavior, see, for example, Neumark et al. (1996) and Goldin and Rouse (2000). Although we do not test for discrimination, Montgomery and Powell (2003), using the first three waves of our data set, found that obtaining an MBA sharply diminishes the gender wage gap, comparing wages of MBAs and non-MBAs. 3. Regarding the challenges of systematically analyzing the labor market outcomes of noncognitive skills, see Borghans et al. (2008) and ter Weel (2008). 4. Psychologists prefer the term character or personality traits (see Thiel and Thomsen 2009). 5. For example, Blau and Kahn (1997), using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) for full-time workers with incomes and labor market experience, found an unadjusted male-female wage ratio of 72.4 percent in 1988. Controlling for human capital variables, occupation, industry, and unionism explains half of the gap. Polachek and Kim (1994), also using the PSID, estimate that half of the male-female earnings differences results from unobserved gender heterogeneity. 6. See, for example, Bowles et al.’s (2001) review of the early explanations of wage differences due to personality and the 2008 Journal of Human Resources symposium issue entitled “The Noncognitive Determinants of Labor Market Outcomes and Behavioral Outcomes.” In response to criticisms of narrowly measuring ability, as of July 2009. the GRE includes a formal measure that attempts to capture noncognitive skills (the “Personal Potential Index”). Grove, Hussey, and Jetter 829 the human capital model as envisioned by Becker (1964) by more fully understanding the variation of individual abilities, especially of noncognitive skills and of work/ life preferences, and how such heterogeneity influences labor market outcomes. Economists have taken three approaches to better understand the gender pay gap. First, the growing lab and field experiment findings about gender differences in, for example, confidence, career-orientation, and assertiveness, are consistent with gender earnings gaps, with the under-representation of women in the upper tier of leadership in professions and corporations, and with the anecdotal evidence of professional women “opting out” of careers; to date, though, little empirical analysis has investigated those potential relationships (Thiel and Thomsen 2009). The notable exceptions focus on the personality traits of the Big Five (see Braakmann 2009; Mueller and Plug 2006) and measures of locus of control and self-esteem (Fortin 2008; Urzua 2008). We test the role of various confidence measures and 15 noncognitive skills (deemed especially important for business professionals) in explaining the MBA male-female pay gap. Secondly, scholars have focused upon gender differences in labor market tastes such as the priority of family, career, wealth, and job characteristics. According to Long (1995) and Fortin (2008), the priority of work and money contributes to the pay gap. Chevalier (2007) finds that women with a preference for childbearing earn less even before they have children due to their choice of college major and because they engage less intensively in job searching (also see Goldin and Polachek 1987). Our data contain a variety of individuals’ priorities regarding family and career, as well as the reported importance of nonpecuniary job attributes, recorded about eight years prior to the earnings data we assess. Finally, because nation-wide data sets, like the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), lack information regarding, for example, college quality, college major, and detailed work histories, researchers have sought smaller, specialized, and homogeneous data sets with greater educational and labor market detail; examples from individual institutions of higher education include studies based on surveys of undergraduates from Harvard College (Goldin and Katz 2008), lawyers from the University of Michigan (Wood, Corcoran, and Courant 1993), and MBAs from the University of Chicago (Bertrand et al. 2009) and the London School of Business (Graddy and Pistaferri 2000). Children, according to Bertrand et al. (2009), mainly contribute to female MBAs’ reduced earnings via fewer hours worked and increased career interruptions. Furthermore, from the Harvard and Beyond data set, female MBAs have greater difficulty balancing careers and children than do medical doctors, lawyers, or Ph.D.s (Goldin and Katz 2008; Herr and Wolfram 2009). In addition to 7. A recent survey by Catalyst, for example, found that “26 percent of women at the cusp of the most senior level of management don’t want the promotion” (Belkin 2003). For anecdotal evidence of high powered professional women “opting out” of careers, see Belkin’s (2003) widely read article in The New York Times Magazine. In contrast, Stone (2007) argues that mostly professional women want to but cannot manage to raise children and function in demanding careers (see also Leonhardt 2010). However, Antecol (2010) find that professional women largely return to work within two years of childbirth. 8. A recent New York Times article entitled “A Labor Market Punishing to Mothers” (Leonhardt 2010), which cites Bertrand et al. (2009), makes a similar argument about professional women generally, noting that the three recent female Supreme Court nominees do not have children. 830 The Journal of Human Resources children, though, Bertrand et al. (2009) also attribute the gender wage gap to differences in MBA training and hours worked. Because these data sets come from individual elite institutions, it is not clear how their results generalize either to typical MBAs or to other average highly educated professionals. The existence of a unique and especially rich data set, the GMAT Registrant Survey, allows us to estimate the role of preferences and noncognitive skills in explaining the gender earnings gap. A stratified random sample of all registrants for the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), the GMAT Registrant Survey, contains longitudinal data in four waves from 1990 to 1998. After registering to take the GMAT but prior to enrolling in an MBA program (Wave I), respondents provided information regarding career and family priorities, 15 noncognitive skills, expected future managerial responsibility, individuals’ job preferences regarding the importance of nonmonetary job characteristics, and information used to create five confidence measures. The data set also provides detailed information about both undergraduate and MBA educational experiences, work histories, earnings, family background, marriage, children, and more. Drawn from a national sample of aspiring MBAs, this data set includes the wide range of MBA program qualities and types available in the United States (Arcidiacono et al. 2007), rather than merely graduates of the most elite programs (for example, Bertrand et al. 2009; Graddy and Pistaferri 2000). Among our sample of MBAs, females employed full-time earn 15.5 percent less per year than do males, a smaller gap than is found in economy-wide data sets (for instance, Blau and Kahn 1997). When we add basic human capital variables (for example, family background, work experience, ability measures, undergraduate and MBA educational experiences), the unexplained gap falls to 9.5 percent, and then further to 6.5 percent with the addition of hours worked and current employment characteristic Collapse"
101042,1990,monthly labor review,raising the minimum wage: effects on family poverty,raising the minimum wage effects on family poverty,"Inequality in the US is steadily growing as a result of the increasing gap in wages due, among other factors, to the erosion in the real value of minimum wages. Although minimum wage policies intend to tackle this problem, an intense partisan debate among politicians has led to the current stalemate of minimum wages. Despite the emerging consensus in academia that the increase of minimum wages has a very limited effect on unemployment, previous research has yielded opposite findings. This is the first study that relies on time series state level data of a long period of time, from 1977 to 2012, to analyze the effect of minimum wages on employment. Using a fixed effects estimator with a sample of 1,576 observations, the findings of this study are in line with the emerging consensus, namely that there is no evidence that the minimum wage has an effect on employment. The results show that the employment elasticity of minimum wage is insignificant in the whole period. However, when analyzing the effect within different subperiods (pre-1990, 1990-1999, and post-1999), the results show that the effect is changing substantially through time. The elasticity was negative before 1990, insignificant in the 1990s, and positive in the 2000s. It seems that the increasing power of firms is turning an efficient lowincome labor market before 1990 into a monopsony low-income labor market in the 2000s. The effect is more significant for youth, particularly for women. It suggests that current minimum wage policies in the US can worsen the lingering high youth unemployment rates. Acknowledgments I would like to acknowledge the Department of Labor, the Census Bureau, and the Department of Commerce for providing the data used in this evaluation and professor Jane Palmer from American University for her helpful suggestions. THE EFFECT OF MINIMUM WAGE POLICIES 2 Inequality and poverty rates in the US are steadily growing (USCB, 2013) as a consequence of the increasing gap in wages and the decline in real value of earnings of lowincome workers. The stalemate of the real value of minimum wages is considered one of the main factors that is driving low-income workers into poverty (Addison & Blackburn, 1999; Daly & Valletta, 2006; Lee, 1999; Leigh, 2007). While minimum wage policies intend to tackle this problem, there is an intense partisan debate about the benefits and risks of imposing a minimum wage. Republicans and the industry oppose any increase in the minimum wage alleging that it will entail employers hiring fewer workers, thus potentially leading to higher inequalities (Crittenden & Nelson, 2014). President Obama has signed an executive order raising the minimum wage for federal contractors (Parsons, 2014) because “no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty” (Obama, 2014, p.arr. 50). Polls show broad support for raising the minimum wage (Crittenden & Nelson, 2014). Almost three-fourths (73%) of the public favors raising the federal minimum wage to overcome increasing inequalities (Pew Research, 2014). Minimum Wage Policies Minimum wage policies started in 1938 when the federal government established a minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Currently, five states do not impose a minimum wage, five states impose a minimum wage under the federal level and forty two states impose a minimum wage equal or above the federal level (DOL, 2014a). A Social Problem of Poverty among Low-Income Workers The relevance of the social problem behind minimum wage policies can be easily seen by comparing the poverty level for a family of four (HHS, 2014) to the yearly income of a full-time worker earning the average of states minimum-wages (DOL, 2014a). A full-time worker earning THE EFFECT OF MINIMUM WAGE POLICIES 3 the minimum wage is far below the poverty level and the situation has only slightly improved in the last 30 years. The problem is exacerbated when considering that the level of poverty in real terms has remained the same, although the real GDP per capita has increased 52% in the same period (DOC, 2014; DOL, 2014b). Current minimum wages condemn low-income workers to poverty as can be seen in figure 1. Do Minimum Wage Policies Reduce Inequality? Inequality has grown steadily in the US in the last years due, among other factors, to the increase in wage gaps. Minimum wage policies are intended to take low-income workers out of poverty and to tackle increasing inequality. The evolution of the Gini index compared to the federal minimum wage is shown in figure 2. From 1969 to 1989 most of the rise in family income inequality was due to the growing dispersion of earnings (Daly & Valletta, 2006). The Figure 1: Full-time worker earnings and poverty level (in 2013 real terms) Source: Compiled by the author based on (DOC, 2014; DOL, 2014a, 2014b; HHS, 2014) THE EFFECT OF MINIMUM WAGE POLICIES 4 observed growth in inequality in the 1980s among low-income workers (Lee, 1999) and women (DiNardo, Fortin, & Lemieux, 1995) was explained by the erosion in the minimum wage which decreased by 27% in real terms between 1979 and 1988 (DiNardo et al., 1995). In the 1990s inequality (Daly & Valletta, 2006) and poverty rates (Addison & Blackburn, 1999) grew at lower rates because of the 16% increase in real terms in the federal minimum wage between 1989 and 1998. However, it is usually stated that minimum-wage policies contribute to destroy lowincome employment, thus potentially increasing both inequality and poverty. Moreover, the effect of minimum wages on poverty household may be overstated because most of these workers, namely young students, are evenly distributed along the entire spectrum of family incomes (Horrigan & Mincy, 1993, p. 251). According to Leigh (2007) the effect of the minimum wage on inequality is unclear because it depends on wage and labor demand elasticities of the industries. Figure 2: Evolution of the household GINI index in the US compared to the federal minimum wage Source: Compiled by the author based on (CBO, 2011) THE EFFECT OF MINIMUM WAGE POLICIES 5 Literature Review Theoretical Framework The economic orthodoxy suggests that in a perfect labor market, an increase in the minimum wage imposes a floor to wages that exceeds the competitive wage, thus decreasing employment (C. C. Brown et al., 1982, p. 488; Cahuc & Zylberberg, 2004, p. 718) as shown in figure 3. This classical view is supported by the industry to defend its arguments against minimum wage policies. However, several factors such as imperfect information, commuting costs, and inertia can generate monopsony powers to firms. The monopsony model shown in figure 4 suggests that an increase in the minimum wage could increase employment because the imposed minimum wage makes employers price-takers and more workers are willing to work at that wage (C. C. Brown et al., 1982, p. 489; Cahuc & Zylberberg, 2004, p. 721). Figure 3: Simple Supply-Demand Model of the effect of minimum wage on employment Source: Compiled by the author based on (C. C. Brown et al., 1982; Cahuc & Zylberberg, 2004) THE EFFECT OF MINIMUM WAGE POLICIES 6 Research before 1990 Supports the Simple Supply-Demand Model Research in the 1970’s and 1980’s, mainly based on time-series analyses, supported the traditional view by finding statistically significant negative employment effects resulting from minimum wage increases (Fox, 2006, p. 3). Several authors (Bernstein & Schmitt, 1998; Card & Krueger, 1995) criticized previous findings by pinpointing important flaws and publication bias. They suggested that these flaws were not analyzed because the results were so thoroughly aligned with the prevailing theory that they were not called into question (Fox, 2006). Neumark and Wascher (1998) evaluated Card and Krueger’s suggestions to conclude that the results of previous studies were not biased. Further Research Challenges the Traditional View Further research has found opposite results. Some studies used cross-sectional regional level data (Lee, 1999) and time series state-level data (Addison & Blackburn, 1999) to find a positive effect of minimum wages on reducing inequality and poverty. Other studies found a Figure 4: Monopsony Model of the effect of minimum wage on employment Source: Compiled by the author based on (C. C. Brown et al., 1982; Cahuc & Zylberberg, 2004) THE EFFECT OF MINIMUM WAGE POLICIES 7 positive effect of minimum wage on employment analyzing data of firms and workers using difference-in-difference estimators (Card, 1992; Card & Krueger, 1993) or OLS and 2SLS regressions (Katz & Krueger, 1992). These findings were highly criticized by Cahuc and Zylberberg (2004) and Neumark and Wascher (1995), but they established a new long-term trend. Today, there is an emerging consensus that the increase of minimum wages has very limited effect on unemployment (EPI, 2006, p. 1). Nobel Laureate Joseph Stieglitz of Columbia University has not found evidence of the effect of minimum wage on unemployment rate and that the minimum wage increase “was totally swamped by other factors going on in the economy” (Chipman, 2006, p.arr. 25). A statement signed by over 650 economists, including five Nobel laureates in economics and six past presidents of the American Economic Association, stated that modest increases in state and federal minimum wages can “significantly improve the lives of low-income workers and their families, without the adverse effects that critics have claimed” (EPI, 2006, p. 1). The dynamic and inefficient nature of low-wage labor markets seems to challenge the traditional view (Bernstein & Schmitt, 1998). Low-wage labor markets seem to generate monopsony powers to firms, thus making them inefficient at the current minimum wage (Ashenfelter, Farber, & Ransom, 2010; Dube, Lester, & Reich, 2011; Manning, 2003). Addison and Blackburn (1999) found that the effect was very different in the 1980’s compared to the 1990’s, suggesting that there might be dissipation thr Collapse"

101050,1990,monthly labor review,would a higher minimum wage help poor families headed by women?,would a higher minimum wage help poor families headed by women,"Social Security's special minimum primary insurance amount (PIA) provision was enacted in 1972 to increase the adequacy of benefits for regular long-term, low-earning covered workers and their dependents or survivors. At the time, Social Security also had a regular minimum benefit provision for persons with low lifetime average earnings and their families. Concerns were rising that the low lifetime average earnings of many regular minimum beneficiaries resulted from sporadic attachment to the covered workforce rather than from low wages. The special minimum benefit was seen as a way to reward regular, low-earning workers without providing the windfalls that would have resulted from raising the regular minimum benefit to a much higher level. The regular minimum benefit was subsequently eliminated for workers reaching age 62, becoming disabled, or dying after 1981. Under current law, the special minimum benefit will phase out over time, although it is not clear from the legislative history that this was Congress's explicit intent. The phaseout results from two factors: (1) special minimum benefits are paid only if they are higher than benefits payable under the regular PIA formula, and (2) the value of the regular PIA formula, which is indexed to wages before benefit eligibility, has increased faster than that of the special minimum PIA, which is indexed to inflation. Under the Social Security Trustees' 2000 intermediate assumptions, the special minimum benefit will cease to be payable to retired workers attaining eligibility in 2013 and later. Their benefits will always be larger under the regular benefit formula. As policymakers consider Social Security solvency initiatives--particularly proposals that would reduce benefits or introduce investment risk--interest may increase in restoring some type of special minimum benefit as a targeted protection for long-term low earners. Two of the three reform proposals offered by the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security would modify and strengthen the current-law special minimum benefit. Interest in the special minimum benefit may also increase because of labor force participation and marital trends that suggest that enhancing workers' benefits may be a more effective means of reducing older women's poverty rates than enhancing spousal or widow's benefits. By understanding the Social Security program's experience with the special minimum benefit, policymakers will be able to better anticipate the effectiveness of other initiatives to enhance benefits for long-term low earners. This article presents the most recent and comprehensive information available about the special minimum benefit in order to help policymakers make informed decisions about the provision's future. Highlights of the current special minimum benefit include the following: Very few persons receive the special minimum benefit. As of December 2001, about 134,000 workers and their dependents and survivors were entitled to a benefit based on the special minimum. Of those, only about 79,000 received a higher total benefit because of the special minimum; the other 55,000 were dually entitled. (In effect, when persons are eligible for more than one type of benefit--that is, they are dually eligible--the highest benefit payable determines total benefits. If the special minimum benefit is not the highest benefit payable, it does not increase total benefits paid.) As of February 2000, retired workers who were special minimum beneficiaries with unreduced benefits and were not dually entitled were receiving, on average, a monthly benefit of $510 per month. That amount is approximately $2,000 less than the annual poverty threshold for an aged individual. Special minimum benefits provide small increases in total benefits. For special minimum beneficiaries who were not dually entitled as of December 2001, the average special minimum monthly PIA was just $39 higher than the regular PIA. Most special minimum beneficiaries are female retired workers. About 90 percent of special minimum beneficiaries are retired workers, and 77 percent of those retired workers are women. The special minimum benefit has never provided poverty-level benefits. Maximum payable special minimum benefits (unreduced for early retirement) equal 85 percent of the poverty level for aged persons, down from 96 percent at the provision's inception. Major public policy considerations raised by this analysis include the following: Social Security benefits alone do not protect all long-term low earners from poverty. Low earners with 30 years of earnings equal to the annual full-time minimum wage who retired in selected years from 1982 to 2000 received benefits that were 3.9 percent to 20.1 percent below the poverty threshold, depending on the year they retired. For 40-year earners, the range was 3.9 percent to 15.3 percent below poverty. Furthermore, in 1993, 29.2 percent of retired-worker beneficiaries who were poor had 30 or more years of coverage. The size of the universe of persistently low earners with significant attachment to the covered workforce is unknown. Available research that examines two 28-month periods suggests that only 4 percent to 6 percent of full-time, full-period earners had below-minimum wages for more than 12 consecutive months. Targeting enhanced benefits only toward long-term, regular workers who are low earners is difficult under the current Social Security program. All else being equal, if total wage-indexed lifetime covered earnings are the same for both a full-career low earner and for a high earner who has worked only occasionally, then their Social Security benefits will be identical. Social Security has no information on number of hours worked, hourly wages, or other information that could distinguish between two such persons. Collapse"
101052,1990,monthly labor review,life insurance benefits for retired workers,life insurance benefits for retired workers,"The concern about the aged after retirement has been raised in Korea and it becomes very important problem to be solved now. The reasons why we have to be are as follows : The increasing in the life expectancy since the mid-70's has resulted in the aged phenomena of the population of the old : Though many retirees still have abilities to work, they have to leave the jobs by the regulation of age limit : So, many employees want to have opportunities to work continuously by re-employment or searching other jobs; Since pension system in Korea hasn't been settled down, yet, most retirees has .suffered from poverty; Because that the ageds social roles has been deprived the retirees by rapid social change through industrialization, they have been isolated from Korean society. Though recently government has asked companies to extend retirement age and to employ the aged supporting financial system, most companies are not providing such opportunities as well as for the retirement. If these opportunities are supported for pre-retirees, they'll develop themselves. secure their family lives, and contribute to development of community as adult learners. Recognizing the necessity of education for adaptation on social life after retirement. the objective of this study is to suggest the theoretical background for making the adult educational program. As basic materials to do it, social policy about the retirement, individual problems faced in this term and its influences on each are studied. First, though there are social policies about the retirement like health. residence, income and other social services in Korea, more positive policies like re-employment system which can extend retirement age are required. Second, retirees faced individual affairs at the family life cycle like children's marriage, separating from them, parents' passing away and realizing of getting old. Third, they faced followings through the retirement; discontinuity of work, no more career, decreasing of income, the responsibility of the retirement grants, adaptation on the new social roles and so on. Though they have opportunities to work continuously, their status, contents of job and wage are different from before. Otherwise, retirement can be defined in various ways. Some theorists regard any person who performs no gainful employment during a given year as retired. Others apply this definition only to those who are currently receiving retirement pension benefits. And still others consider anyone who is not employed full time, year around, as retired. In Korea, the considerable focus on the retirement is divided into such as the retirees' committing suicide, unsatisfying act and/or regulation for retirees. the extension of the average length of life. On an aspect of demographic consideration, the proportion of older people who retired has increased dramatically since the turn of 1960s : 961, 319 in 1966 to 1,749,549 ill 1985 over 65 of age. Pertaining to the focus, this research aimed to check the late adulthood's living surrounds, to study the institutional system on the mandatory retirement, and to settle down the criteria for formal retirement preparation program. For purposes of the present discussion, a retired person is one who is not employed at a full-time paying job and who receives at least some income from a pension due to prior employment. The retirement is an earned reward, one that results from having previously been a member of the labor forces. Also, retirement means a total separation from the world of work. Lots of retirees anticipate financial problems during retirement, even though these also expect retirement to reduce their income up to 50% from pre-retirement. Few employees take concrete action to ensure that their retirement income will be adequate. However, there is no indication that this lack of formal pre-retirement planning has any substantial impact on postr-etirement well-being. Since voluntary retirement affect only a very small number of employees, the decision to retire must often be due to other reasons. These include the employee's job level and job satisfaction, age discrimination and employer pressures to retire, actual and self-perceived health, the expectation of a more enjoyable life, and the influence of one's family, friends. and coworkers. Phases of retirement have been suggested that retirees tend to proceed through a series of distinct psychological and emotional stages. Retirement may well begin with a euphoric and busy honeymoon phase, during which the individual eagerly tries to do many of the things that were ruled out by full-time work. This intense activity may be follwed a period of letdown or disenchantment, especially if the individual's prior expectation of retirement were unrealistically positive. And other phase, the retirement produces a substantial drop income, so much so that the retiree's standard of living and satisfaction with life are adversely affected. And another phases are those retirees' facing on poor health, nothing to do, and the biggest loneliness. Here again, the voluntary retiree is an optimistic one: the minority find retirement to be a busy and satisfying period. In particular, those individuals who developed satisfying hobbies and recreational activities prior to retirement are most likely to enjoy their years away from full-time work. However, those who had few avocations during their working years may well find that retirement is disenchanting and depressing. After retirement the important factors to make life are time, money and relation with others. First, retirees should spend their time effectively whatever they would do. If they fail to do it, they can get bad mental conditions like tension, despair, irratation and so on. Second, only with dependence on pension, insurance and savings, they can't cope with inflation. Third, if they fail to relate with others continuously, they'll feel seriously isolated. In conclusion, this study couldn't find out to be any kinds of the mandatory retirement policy for them, to subsidize those retirees beyond the retirement pension, to solve both psychological and emotional problems of their having faced, and to be carried out the retirement preparation program. Therefore, this project suggest to keep implementing of their role playing in social activities; to be instructed as techniques on the interest raising between save and withdraw of pension; to be daily exercised for the health betterment and maintaining; to inquire into working alone, working with others, and working half and half; to prepare, and then to participate the retirement preparation program; and to be specialized for post-retirement well-being. Retirees should have wisdom to turn this critical moment into opprotunity to deveolop themselves. Social policy also offer such an opprotunity, too. However, the retiree's can be helped to make their renew life desirable through the programs viz, how the eged cope with his/her life So, educational programs for the retirees to adapt on their new life should be developed considering such suggestions as ; Financial reward should be offered through taking educational programs: These programs should satisfy the needs to belong to somewhere; Participation in any institutions should offer chances to share retirees' experiences with the young workers and to enhance their abilities to communicate with many others; Educational researcher should find out the common interest which the retirees want to learn regardless of their various characteristics; Many informations about how the retirees cope with the life after retirement should be presented before retirement. These informations should be open to anyone; Educational programs should be very practical which can be adated on daily life; and Educational programs should solve the aged' affectional problem like loneliness, despairs and so on.

101074,1990,national tax journal,iras and national savings,iras and national savings,"A growing body of evidence suggests that young people have a low level of financial understanding and that they are making poor financial choices. It is a development reflected in part in savings rates. Personal saving is calculated as disposable income less personal spending. The U.S. personal savings rate has fallen since the early 1990s. From 1990 to 1995, the average annual rate of personal savings was 8.72 percent. From 1997 to 2001, the average annual rate was 3.32 percent. This percentage of savings suggests that American households are financially overextended. The problem is also reflected in various measures of students' knowledge. Lewis Mandell, dean of the university at Buffalo's School of Management, has conducted a national survey on the financial understanding of twelfth grade students for the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit Jump$tart Coalition. (1) The survey, carried out in 1997, 2000, and 2002, measures twelfth graders' knowledge of money, income, saving, spending, and credit; it also inquires about students' personal finance such as use of money and credit. The 2002 survey was administered to 4,024 twelfth graders in 183 schools nationally; on average, these students answered 50.2 percent of the questions correctly. The average score in the 2000 survey was 51.9 percent; in 1997, it was 57.3 percent. Students' knowledge and understanding, as measured by the Jump$tart survey, has been declining nationally. A study conducted for Northwestern Mutual Financial Network by the market research firm Harris Interactive, titled Generation 2001: The Second Study, (2) focused on a national, representative sample of college seniors. It was a follow-up to a study conducted in 1997 when the students of the class of 2001 were freshmen. The results offer some insight into the attitudes of this generation, including attitudes related to financial matters. Here the results reveal important knowledge gaps and a disconnect between attitude and behavior: * Nearly half (48 percent) of college seniors felt ""not very knowledgeable"" or ""not very knowledgeable at all"" regarding financial matters. * Despite their lack of knowledge, nearly three-quarters believed it was very likely that they would eventually be able to afford the life-style of their childhood. * While college students rated home ownership, life insurance, 401(k)s, and IRAs as important financial instruments, far fewer expressed high levels of knowledge about these instruments. * These college students held, on average, three credit cards each, and most had already incurred a significant debt load. Why Do People Appear to Fail to Act in Their Financial Best Interest? A basic assumption of economics is that people act in their own best interest. But the evidence discussed previously suggests that when it comes to saving, investing, and credit management, people's knowledge is minimal and their actions may not be in their best interest. Why? Let's look more closely. We know that in other arenas, people often engage in risk-oriented behavior. Some people play football or compete in rodeos when they know they might injure their knees and backs, or worse. Some people smoke when they know smoking causes cancer and heart disease. Some people drive fast and change lanes recklessly even when they know that, in doing so, they could kill themselves and others. People do many things that do not appear to be in their best interest. They also incur risk by virtue of what they do not do-not eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and fish, for example, despite well-known evidence about the health benefits associated with such a diet. Why might people fail to act in the best interests of their own health? Consider the costs and benefits involved-as they might be assessed by the people whose behavior seems, in these cases, to be irrational. For many among us, the cost of eating a healthful diet is immediate and real. … Collapse"

Its simultaneous consideration of fiscal variables overturns the results of some existing studies. While taxes seem negatively associated with GDP growth, they are concommitant with a higher rate of growth when their benefits in terms of reducing deficits are taken into account. The positive association of government expenditures with GDP growth is rendered negative when their impact on deficits are factored in. Deficits are contractionary, and deficit-reducing tax increases and expenditure cuts are positively associated with growth. A balanced budget expansion of taxes and expenditures is negatively associated with growth. When separating the sample into low-, middle- and high-income countries, these results hold only for the second group indicating that the level of development influences the linkages between fiscal variables and GDP growth.

No less authority on the topic than Captain John Smith reported that lotteries were ""the reall and substantial food by which Virginia has been nourished."" (Johnson, 1960: 161.) Later, lotteries were used by the Continental Congress and several colonies to fund the Revolutionary War, and such venerable institutions as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Dartmouth benefited from their use (Kaplan, 1984). In more recent times, lotteries provided an important source of revenues for the depressed post-Civil War Southern states. But criticism regarding their moral implications and corruption in their operation is given as the explanation for Congressional action that foreclosed state lotteries in 1895 by prohibiting the use of the mail for distributing lottery tickets and information (Tillett, 1983).

The purpose of this paper is to informally demonstrate that the Banks set is a solution set of broad relevance for understanding group decision making in both cooperative and non-cooperative settings and under both sincere and sophisticated voting. In addition, we show how sincere and sophisticated voting processes can be viewed as mirror images of one another — embodying respectively, “dmemory” and “foresight.” We also show how to develop the idea of a “sophisticated agenda,” one in which the choice of what alternatives to propose is itself a matter of strategic calculation.

101187,1990,public choice,investments in rent-seeking,investments in rent seeking,"In this article we examine the extent to which three minority groups were able to achieve selected neighborhood social and physical outcomes in the San Francisco mnetropolitan area. Ecological regressions were estimated to generate elasticities that measure the relative abilities of blacks, Hispanics, and Asians to convert education and income into desirable neighborhood environments. These regressions were interpreted in light of substantial differences between the three groups in levels of residential segregation. Results generally indicated a black disadvantage in the process of residential achievement, but it was not as dramatic as that found in earlier studies or as great as the levels of segregation would suggest. As in prior research, education was found to be the critical variable in explaining spatial differentiation and class stratification among blacks. In the United States, residences are allocated to persons and families through private housing markets. Since public housing comprises less than 2% of the nation's housing stock, and less than 1% of its housing starts (Adams 1987), virtually all households seeking a new residence enter the rental or sale market. Each household has a set of housing needs and desires based on its size, composition, life-cycle stage, and tastes; it also has a set of economic resources with which to achieve these desires, principally capital assets and income. Markets allocate households to specific residences through the mechanism of price; households purchase or rent the home that best suits their needs at the price they can afford (Berry & Rees 1969). According to neoclassic economic theory, the price of housing reflects the balance between aggregate demand and supply within local markets (Alonso 1964; Mills 1972). Researchers have pointed out, however, that housing is different from other commodities, and that these differences structure housing markets in distinct ways. First, residences are immobile; they are tied to a particular piece of land and cannot easily be consumed elsewhere (Logan & Molotch 1987). Second, they represent a very significant investment for most families, and for homeowners are the primary means of capital accumulation *Direct correspondence to the authors at the Population Research Center, University of Chicago, 1155 E. 60th Street, Chicago, IL 60637. i) The University of North Carolina Press Social Forces, September 1990, 69(1):15-32 This content downloaded from 157.55.39.104 on Mon, 20 Jun 2016 06:09:10 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms 16 / Social Forces 69:1, September 1990 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1986). Third, each residence is not only tied to a particular plot of land, it is also bound to a specific neighborhood (Massey et al. 1987) and, in turn, to a larger municipality (Logan 1978). Moreover, each geographic unit is associated with a social environment defined by the behaviors of residents and the service benefits provided by local government (Schneider & Logan 1982, 1985; Massey et al. 1987). Finally, houses, and the communities in which they are found, are more than mere commodities; they are also objects of powerful sentiments that influence judgments and condition decisions (Logan & Molotch 1987). In recognition of the fact that housing is immobile and linked to particular places, Charles Tiebout (1956) proposed a ""pure theory of local expenditures"" to account for the differentiated residential structure of cities. The theory rests on two key assumptions that households are free to move, and that places compete to attract them. Local governments offer different packages of tax costs, service benefits, and zoned environments from which home seekers choose. Over time, market competition produces a variety of service-tax-environment mixes and distributes households among them according to income, preferences, and wealth, yielding a residential structure differentiated by socioeconomic status, family life-cycle stage, race, and ethnicity. Although Tiebout's model recognizes some unique features of housing markets, it does not incorporate the fact that housing costs, and particularly home-ownership costs, reflect a substantial investment for families, or that homes, neighborhoods, and communities are the focus of strong emotional attachments. These traits give rise to what Stinchcombe (1965) calls ""communities of fate,"" where residents and institutions have large stakes not only in their own property, but in the property and characteristics of people in surrounding areas, making collective action highly likely. This propensity for collective action segments housing markets along social lines, so that individual choices are constrained by institutional practices and the collective behavior of others (Logan & Molotch 1987). The segmentation of housing markets, and the constraints it imposes on individual home seekers, are well illustrated by the case of U.S. blacks. The Tiebout model and its successors (Bish 1971; Peterson 1981) assume that households are free to move wherever their tastes and economic resources take them. Given this assumption, racial segregation is interpreted simply as the coincidental by-product of sorting based on income, wealth, and tastes (viz. Clark 1986). Considerable evidence, however, indicates that segregation does not stem from black preferences or low black-income levels. Public opinion polls show that blacks strongly endorse the principle of residential integration (Schuman et al. 1985) and express a clear preference for living in integrated neighborhoods, other things being equal (Farley et al. 1978). In spite of these tastes for integration, however, desegregation does not follow from the simple acquisition of socioeconomic resources sufficient to support spatial mobility. As education, income, and occupation rise, black-white segregation does not decline, but persists at a very high level (MIassey 1979, 1981; Denton & Massey 1988). Rather than reflecting tastes or socioeconomic status, black segregation appears to stem from constraints to black residential mobility imposed by the This content downloaded from 157.55.39.104 on Mon, 20 Jun 2016 06:09:10 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms Segregation and Neighborhood Quality / 17 collective behavior and institutional actions of whites. Studies of the real estate industry, for example, indicate that discrimination and prejudice are still widespread. Real estate agents systematically steer black home seekers away from white neighborhoods, and provide them less favorable treatment than whites (Molotch 1972; Pearce 1976; Wienk et al. 1979; Yinger 1986), actions which have been linked analytically to high levels of residential segregation (Galster 1986). At the same time, lending institutions have been found to finance a disproportionately small number of loans in black neighborhoods, even after objective social and economic factors are controlled (Taggart & Smith 1981; Pol et al. 1982; Leahy 1985). Moreover, in the few cases where blacks succeed in entering a white neighborhood, they are frequently met by organized white resistance and hostility (Hirsch 1983; Cass 1986; Bauman 1987), especially in working-class areas (Logan & Stearns 1981; Stearns & Logan 1986a); and if blacks succeed in establishing themselves, the neighborhood is quite likely to be avoided by subsequent white home seekers, resulting in eventual resegregation (Massey & Mullan 1984). Thus, the collective action of white residents and the institutional practices in the real estate and banking industries bifurcate urban housing markets along racial lines, fostering high levels of segregation despite a strong demand by blacks for integration. Some studies suggest that Hispanics face similar barriers, but to a lesser degree (Hakken 1979; James & Tynan 1986). The effect of a racially segmented housing market in creating and sustaining segregation is crucial to understanding the socioeconomic position of blacks in the United States. Barriers to spatial mobility are, in a very real way, barriers to social mobility. As Logan and Molotch (1987:49) point out, socioeconomic inequality among households and geographic inequality among places are not independent; the two systems of hierarchy reinforce one another: ""High status within the social hierarchy can bring access to the most desirable places ... and a guarantee of a rewarding future for whatever place one controls. At the same time a high status for one's geographical place means the availability of resources . . . that enhance life chances generally."" In a similar vein, Giddens (1980:107-12) argues that segregation is a core mechanism of class structuration, since it concentrates people of low status in space and ensures the maintenance of behaviors and orientations detrimental to success in the larger society. In this article we demonstrate how segregation structures the neighborhood environment achieved by three minority groups in one large urban area. We estimate the degree to which blacks, Hispanics, and Asians are able to convert socioeconomic achievements into selected neighborhood outcomes within the San Francisco-Oakland Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1980. The analysis proceeds in three phases. First, we establish the degree of segregation experienced by blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in the San Francisco SMSA. We then consider the extent to which the degree of segregation faced by each group affects its ability to convert status attainments into neighborhood social outcomes. Finally, we evaluate the degree to which each group is able to convert status attainments into different physical characteristics of the neighborhood environment.

Such concave preferences might characterize decision problems in which, say, a site must be selected for some obnoxious facility, such as a prison, garbage dump, or facility for managing hazardous materials. The results indicate that, under these conditions, the (weak a-)core can be structurally unstable, changing discontinuously with apparently minor perturbations of the decision problem. The main theorem identifies a curious property of the core when the set of feasible alternatives is compact and convex and each agent's preferences are strictly concave. Namely, a point in the feasible set's interior can belong to the core only if there is no feasible alternative that makes every member of any winning coalition strictly worse off. In this sense, an interior point belongs to the core only if it lies in ""the pits."" Collapse"

For the first time, we utilize a comprehensive model of dust evolution, which includes growth, fragmentation, and sedimentation. Specific attention is paid to the influence of grain evolution on the penetration of the UV field in the disk. A chemical model that includes a comprehensive set of gas-phase and grain-surface chemical reactions is used to simulate the chemical structure of the disk. The main effect of grain evolution on the disk's chemical composition comes from sedimentation and, to a lesser degree, from reduction of the total grain-surface area. The net effect of grain growth is suppressed by the fragmentation process which maintains a population of small grains, dominating the total grain surface area. We consider three models of dust properties. In model GS, both growth and sedimentation are taken into account. In models A5 and A4, all grains are assumed to be the same size (10?5?cm and 10?4?cm, respectively) with a constant gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100. As in previous studies, the three-layer pattern (cold midplane, warm molecular layer, and hot atmosphere) in the disk-chemical structure is preserved in all models, but shifted closer to the midplane in models with increased grain size (GS and A4). Unlike other similar studies, we find that in models GS and A4, the column densities of most gas-phase species are enhanced by 1-3 orders of magnitude relative to those in a model with pristine dust (A5), while column densities of their surface counterparts are decreased. We show that column densities of certain species, such as C2H, HC2n+1N (n = 0-3), H2O, and some other molecules, as well as the C2H2/HCN abundance ratio, all of which are accessible with Herschel and ALMA, can be used as observational tracers of early stages of the grain evolution process in PPDs.

Even in a long run competitive environment with perfect markets for managers, unlimited duplication of the firm may not be economically feasible. We first analyze in a general setting and then illustrate in two stylized examples, the interplay between individual decisional quality, time required for an individual decision, direct and indirect costs of decision making, and the optimal number of decision makers (for example, management size).

The structure of the boards is important because it helps to define the constraints on the board members and on the internal agents of the universities. An implication of this study is that public universities can be made to function more like private ones by placing them under separate governing boards.These results are especially interesting when examining the trends regarding board structures. The trend over this century across the states has been toward increasing the number of universities under the jurisdiction of a single board. This analysis suggests that the trend is a response to political pressure from educators, not from taxpayers and consumers of higher education. Collapse"

In order to evaluate our efforts, consider Table 5. For a large majority (15) of the 18 relevant runs, the ideological variable is significant. Our measure of constituent economic interests does not eliminate the explanatory power of the ideological voting variable, but this does not indicate shirking. As opposed to shirking, we may observe ideological voting because (1) it provides brand name capital, (2) it represents the ideological preferences of the constituents, or (3) it acts as a measure of median voter economic preferences. Further, ADA scores do not allow us to differentiate between these competing explanations.Table 5. Comparison of House and Senate resultsEconomic variableIdeological variableHouseSenateTotalSignificantNot significantSignificantNot significantKalt-Zupan Insignificant——4—4Kalt-Zupan Significant332—8Peltzman Insignificant——3—3Peltzman Significan——3—3Total3312018 For 11 of the 18 models one of the economic variables accounts for a significant portion of the variance in the dependent variables. The results derived from our measure of constituent economic interests contradict most findings of the LASI school and raise questions about the validity of the empirical characterization of constituent interests in that research.A breakdown of the results by chamber indicates that significant differences in the degree of ideological voting between the House and Senate may exist. This is important in that most research has focused only on the Senate where ideological voting is more prevalent. For the House, Table 5 reveals the constituent economic interest variable isalways significant, and in fully one-half of the relevant regressions it is theonly significant variable, knocking ADA out of the race. As noted earlier, the insignificance of ADA is some indication of the absence of ideological shirking though its significance may indicate only measurement error, voter ideology, or reputational capital. In the Senate, the results are more evenly split, though it is clear that the adjusted (for reelection constituency) economic interest variable is an improvement. ADA is significant in all 12 Senate regressions, and the respective economic variables are significant in 5, or just under half.This side-by-side comparison is provocative, though it remains to be tested in detail. But our preliminary conclusions can be stated as follows. First, as Peltzman (1984) suggested, a better specification of economic interest and constituency representation reduces, though it does not eliminate, the role of the ADA variable in the Senate. Second, we find evidence that ideological shirking, if it exists, is much smaller in the House. In fact, from an institutional perspective, it can be argued that economic interests are dominant, since House districts are smaller and more homogeneous. Further, the shorter terms for House members may make them more directly accountable to voters, and smaller groups of voters may force a lesser reliance on pure ideological campaigning and require a more personal presentation of self.

Women and Society in Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Successor States. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999. 343 pp. $55.00, cloth. $18.95, paper. Gender Politics in the Western Balkans is a collection of fifteen articles on various aspects of gender politics in Yugoslavia and its successor states. Written by historians, social scientists, literary critics and human rights activists, the essays address both the socio-economic and the political issues that have affected women in the region. The book is divided into four uneven parts: Overview (two chapters); the Interwar Era, World War 11, and the Socialist Era (four chapters); Post-Socialist Republics (six chapters); and Literature and Religion (three chapters). The editor, Sabrina P. Ramet, reminds us in her introduction that ""in the course of the twentieth century, Yugoslav women have lived under six different systems: dynastic monarchy (in the years up to 1918), constitutional monarchy (most of the years between 1918 and 1941), fascist occupation (1941-45), communist one-party rule (1945-90), flawed democracy (Slovenia and Macedonia since 1990), and nationalism (Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia since 1990)"" (p. 5). The emergence, nature, disintegration, and the various mutations of the Yugoslav, Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian, Bosnian, and Kosovar nation states form the historical and socioeconomic background framing the other issues addressed in the collection. These include the South Slav family structure; underdevelopment, poverty and economic scarcity; women's struggles; changing constructions of identities based on gender, nationality/ethnicity, and sexual orientation; and the role of war and other crises in both the deconstruction of the existing gendered (and ethnic) order and the (re)construction of a new one. The South Slav family structure and dynamics, in particular the syndrome of the ""self-sacrificing micro-matriarchy,"" are introduced by Andrei Simic in Chapter Two. The author analyzes the power relations within the typical Yugoslav family from an anthropological perspective in terms of three dyads: husband/wife, mother/son, and daughter-in-law/mother-in-law. ""In the absence of an affectual tie to her husband, and as a reaction to the dominance of her mother-in-law,"" Simic argues, ""the young wife cultivates unusually strong reciprocal links with her children"" (p. 21). In time, the close relationship between an elderly mother and adult sons) enables the mother to exert considerable influence and power both within and outside the family. The author characterizes the resultant gender system as a ""cryptomatriarchy."" In her comment on Simic's article in the concluding ""Afterword,"" Branka Magas attributes the continuing influence on urban life of machismo and cryptomatriarchy to the acute housing shortage during the communist period, the relatively recent industrialization, and, above all, ""the low labor mobility caused by the life-long job security characteristic of all communist societies. An unintended outcome of this `socialist gain' was the fact that rules governing kinship in the countryside were extended to the cities-with the difference that, in the latter, matri-locality as well as the usual patri-locality became the norm. In its desire to prevent the rule of capital, the communist system thus conserved older norms of life"" (p. 289). Cryptomatriarchy has continued to flourish in contemporary Serbia, with paradoxical effects. Sarana Papi6 describes Milo""sevic's Serbia as a society characterized by ""the equality of powerlessness,"" where ""women are treated as an inexhaustible resource, not only in the everyday art of survival but as the procreative saviors of the dying Nation"" (p. 164), while men continue to be seen as ""natural"" warriors. However, Papi also points out that ""Milogevid's exclusive masculinized power emasculates all other men; economically and politically"" (p. … Collapse"
101206,1990,public choice,"bureaucracy, inefficiency, and time",bureaucracy inefficiency and time,"Consider General Motors Corporation. GM seems like a giant Sequoia tree rotting slowly from the top. Theories abound as to why: myopic management; hubris; politics, vertical integration, inefficiency, outdated plant and equipment, the Icarus Paradox (Miller 1990), resistance to change; permanently failing organizations (Meyer and Zucker 1989), the unions; and so forth. GM is a dinosaur (Loomis 1993) stuck in a time warp with a “gargantuan bureaucracy” (Kerwin 1998, p. 26) that, as a high cost producer of low quality cars, is well off the efficiency curve. And it is not that there isn’t motive. The industry is very competitive and everyone in the industry knows GM is below the curve. Further, GM has spent billions trying to get back on the curve—some say they have spent more than the total asset value of Toyota. What is not working at GM and can organization science explain it? Like Gaul, organization science is divided into three parts: rational, natural, and open systems (Scott 1998). The rational system view, the visible hand Chandler (1977) calls it, puts the blame on managers. The natural system view—the invisible hand—tells us that the emergent structure is apparently defeating whatever good ideas the managers do come up with. And the open systems view? It focuses on environmental effects and boundary transactions. Paradigm proliferation (Donaldson 1995) further delineates views within Scott’s broad framework. Much as one might like some of the newer paradigms, Pfeffer (1997) cautions that much of the paradigm proliferation in organization science results from fads and fashion. He quotes himself 16 years earlier, saying, “If we use relatively simpler processes and models the world will appear to be simpler and more certain.... We overlook the potential for finding simpler models to describe the world” (1981, p. 411). So, in this chapter I reduce Scott’s framework to four driving forces: adaptive tension, self-organization (by managers or nonmanagers), interdependency effects, and multilevel coevolution. Ironically Pfeffer (1997) decries the dangerous liaison with economics while simultaneously calling for simplicity. The one thing economists’ penchant for mathematical models has created is a constant drive for simplicity. They focus on just a few key variables otherwise the mathematics becomes intractable. Following the direction of current philosophy of science, embodied in Campbellian Realism (McKelvey this volume), I not only follow Pfeffer and the economists in emphasizing parsimony, but also take a step in the direction of a formal model-centered organization science by framing my complexity theory application to firms in terms of computational models.1 Campbellian Realism calls, in part, for scientists to coevolve the development of theory and model so as to maximize “experimental adequacy” tests—the theory predicts model behavior and the model allows testing of the intricacies of the theory. Section 2 develops: (1) Self-Organization Theory—If the level of adaptive tension falls outside a region defined by the chaos theorists’ “critical values” (Cramer 1993),2 the resulting complexity field will not support the emergence of structures necessary for constructive adaptation; and (2) Complexity Catastrophe Theory—If the conditions of complexity catastrophe exist, Friedman’s (1953) natural selection based constrained maximization or Campbell’s blind variation, selection, and retention (BVSR) processes may function properly and yet fail to produce the kinds of intrafirm behavior necessary for survival and growth in a selectionist competitive context. Together these theories state that (1) critical value effects creating emergent structure in the mid range of adaptive tension; and (2) complexity effects on the flat and jagged extremes of rugged landscapes combine to produce a nonlinear inverted U effect on organizational performance relative to adaptive tension and complexity. Section 3 illustrates how to set up the groundwork for testing experimental adequacy. The model frameworks come from Kauffman (1993). I draw on both his Boolean statistical mechanics and his NK[C] model. I conclude that (1) self-organization and complexity catastrophe theories offer useful insights into the prolonged poor performance of large complex organizations such as GM; and (2) computational modeling approaches offer a basis for testing the Collapse"

A concrete example of such complements is gasoline and automobiles. Because of complementarity, investment in automobiles depends on the price of gas. Since cars bought today will be around for several years, there is a dynamic link between the current price of gas and future demand for gas. OPEC has a strategic incentive to set a low oil price today since a low price promotes investment in big cars and other oil-fueled equipment which, in turn, increases the future profit of the oil industry. Consumer investment in product-specific capital is a feature of the markets for many products, especially if one takes a broad perspective of what this capital decision can be. For instance, continuing the example of the gas market, the decision to reside far from work is analogous to the decision to buy a big car since (1) the decision may be influenced by the current price of gas and (2) the decision affects an individual's future demand for gas. As another example consider the demand for phone service. In response to a low price of phone service, businesses makes capital decisions such as the purchase of computer telemarketing machines and other phone equipment. The businesses may also configure their marketing strategy to use (human) phone contact rather than direct personal contact, and such a strategy involves investment in human capital. These investment decisions all tend to make the future demand for phone service relatively inelastic. This paper presents a model in which there are capital goods, ""cars,"" which can be used for two periods, and a consumption good, ""gas,"" which fuels the cars. Big cars are gas guzzlers; i.e., car size and gas are complements. Consumers select the size of their car on the basis of the current price of gas and their expectations of the future Collapse"
101224,1990,quarterly journal of economics,export subsidies as an outcome of the management-labor conspiracy,export subsidies as an outcome of the management labor conspiracy,"A mercantilistic trade policy is often introduced as a tool to generate more jobs in some key industries. When employment in an export (import) industry is perceived to be low, the government would be tempted to adopt measures of export promotion (import protection) to increase it. By effectively guaranteeing employment, however, these policies would reduce incentives for the private sector to reach efficient labor contracts. For example, the labor union might refuse to sign a profit-sharing contract with management and unilaterally demand high wages, believing that the resulting loss in competitiveness would not affect the well-being of its members, since the government would protect the industry. It is also conceivable that management and the labor union conspire to reach inefficient contracts so as to invite government intervention. In certain cases trade policies only transfer income without any allocative effect. This is not merely a theoretical curiosum. Free trade advocates have often pointed out that protectionist policies would have deleterious effects on the pattern of collective bargaining in the trade-sensitive sectors.' This paper constructs simple models to illustrate this point for export subsidies, and so it can be viewed as an addition to the literature that aims to bring attention to the pitfalls of the new mercantilism, such as Eaton and Grossman [1986], Dixit and Grossman [1986], and Horstman and Markusen [1986]. Unlike these studies, however, the government policies considered here are reactive in the sense that the private sector moves first, anticipating the government's response.

The evidence indicates that there is substantial information in the longer maturity term structure about futureinflation: the slope of the term structure does have a great deal of predictive power for future changes in inflation. On the other hand, at the longer maturities, the term structure of nominal interest rates contains very little information about the term structure of real interest rates. These results are strikingly different from those found for very short-term maturities, six months or less, in previous work. For maturities of six months or less, the term structure contains no information about the future path of inflation, but it does contain a great deal of information about the term structure of real interest rates. The evidence in this paper does indicate that, at longer maturities, the term structure of interest rates can be used to help assess future inflationary pressures: when the slope of the term structure steepens, it is an indication that the inflation rate will rise in the future and when the slope falls, it is an indication that the inflation rate will fall. However, we must still remain cautious about using the evidence presented here to advocate that the Federal Reserve should target on the term structure in conducting monetary policy. A change in Federal Reserve operating procedures which focuses on the term structure may well cause the relationship between the term structure and future inflation to shift, with the result that the term structure no longer remains an accurate guide to the path of future inflation. If this were to occur, Federal Reserve monetary policy could go far astray by focusing on the term structure of interest rates. Collapse"

Our focus is the short-haul pricing constraint, a provision of the ICA that prohibited railroads from charging higher rates to isolated, primarily agrarian shippers than it charged to intercity shippers of similar commodities. Utilizing the event study methodology, we find that the impending passage of the ICA generated a distribution of abnormal returns to railroads and shipping firms that is consistent with the theoretical implications of our analysis of the short-haul pricing constraint (SHPC). However, early interpretations of the SHPC by the Interstate Commerce Commission reduced some of the abnormal returns to railroads in a manner that is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the short-haul pricing constraint was an important mechanism of early railroad regulation. The analysis does support a multiple-interest interpretation of the Interstate Commerce Act and has implications for the positive theory of regulation. Collapse"

One important potential problem raised by critics of franchise bidding is the ability of franchise winners to engage in ex post opportunistic behavior by reneging on the promises that they made in order to win the franchise contract. The results of my analysis suggest that although franchise competition does lead firms to engage in some degree of opportunistic behavior, the extent of opportunism is not severe. Furthermore, reputation effects appear to play a role in constraining firm behavior, while rate regulation actually seems to exacerbate ex post behavioral problems. Collapse"

Using a cluster analysis to compare the 1985-1987 fertility patterns of different boroughs of London, demographers learned that 5 natural groupings occurred. 4 boroughs in a central London cluster have the distinction of having a low TFR (1.38) and late fertility (average age of 29.58 years). The researchers attributed these occurrences to the high levels of employment and career attachment and low rates of marriage among women in this cluster. 2 inner city boroughs constituted the smallest cluster and had the largest TFR (2.37), mainly due to high numbers of births to the ethnic minorities. The largest cluster consisted of 12 boroughs located mainly along the periphery with 2 centrally located boroughs (TFR, 1.79). Some of the upper class outer boroughs characterized another cluster with a TFR of 1.61. Another cluster made up of inner and outer boroughs in east and southeast London had a ample proportion of manual worker (TFR, 2.04). Social class most likely accounted for the contrast in TFRs between the 2 aformentioned clusters. Demographers observed that cyclical fluctuation of fertility occurred as opposed to secular trends. Due to these fluctuations, demographers used autoregressive moving average forecast models to time series of the fertility variables in London since 1952. They also applied structural time series models which included regression variables and the influence of cyclical and/or trend behavior. The results showed that large cohorts and the increase in female economic activity caused a delay in the modal age of births and a reduction in the number of births. Collapse"

It starts from a position where regional financial markets are fully integrated in a national system, with regional financial institutions having a neutral effect on their regional economy. It then indicates how interregional differences in information costs can result in a degree of inter-regional financial market segmentation, creating conditions under which regional interest rates can diverge from national rates. The theoretical analysis also demonstrates how market segmentation, resulting from financial institutions with elements of regional autonomy, can impact upon a region's ability to undertake profitable investment.

101254,1990,regional science and urban economics,panel data analysis of housing choices,panel data analysis of housing choices,"Abstract Housing choices have almost exclusively been analyzed either by using survey data gathered at a specific point in time or by using time-series of aggregate data. Panel data permits use of both time-series and cross-sectional variation, thereby providing a substantially superior identification and seperation of the various economic and demographic mechanisms underlying housing choice behavior which are often confounded in the snapshot analysis of cross-sectional data and by aggregation in time-series analysis. In this paper, a longitudinal discrete choice model of the choice of housing tenure and size is presented and estimated using five linked cross-sections of the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics, 1977 to 1981. We employ the conditional fixed effects multinomial logit model [FEMNL, Chamberlain (1980)] in order to account for time-invariant heterogeneity across households. These panel data results differ in many respects from results obtained from single and pooled cross-sections. First, price and income elasticities appear substantially overestimated in cross-sectional analysis as opposed to time-series and panel data analysis. Second, life-age effects are confounded by calendar-time specific effects and therefore may yield implausible results in cross-sectional analysis. In general, the influence of demographic variables appears to be understated in cross-sectional estimation. Collapse"

Because the short-run players are unconcerned about the future, each equilibrium outcome is constrained to lie on their static reaction (best-response) curves. The natural extension of the folk theorem to games of this sort would simply include this constraint in the definitions of the feasible payoffs and minmax values. In fact, this extension does obtain under the assumption that each player's choice of a mixed strategy for the stage game is publicly observable but, in contrast to standard repeated games, the set of equilibrium payoffs is different if players can observe only their opponents' realized actions.

We then examine the possibility that the time series contain unit roots. We are unable to reject this hypothesis for the variables in question. This suggests using procedures for detrending nonstationary time series suggested by Beveridge and Nelson. Such an analysis is performed and the implications are discussed.

This idea has important implications for consumer behavior, and economists have begun to think about it, but they have given it little empirical attention. Using the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances, we find that private transfers do tend to be targeted toward consumers who face credit rationing. But we also find that a substantial fraction of U.S. consumers are liquidity-constrained even if one allows for the possibility of private transfers. Collapse"

In particular, their role in today's most popular models of investment, the rational flexible accelerator and Tobin's q, is considered. In the analysis it is assumed that costs of adjusting the level of quasi-fixed inputs affects the firm's operations independently of specific optimal decision rules for investment. The results show that the pattern of adjustment costs is consistent with the solution of the optimization problem faced by the firm. However, such structure is more complex than what is usually postulated in the literature. Finally costs of adjustment represent a significant portion of the unit cost of new capital goods. Collapse"

A series of Monte Carlo experiments were conducted to show how a proposed switch to annuity depreciation would affect accounting estimates of two measures of economic profitability: the rate of return and q, the ratio of a firm's market value to its replacement cost. Annuity depreciation significantly improved the accounting rate of return but had little effect on estimates of q. Some of the improvement in the rate of return and almost all the improvement in q could be obtained if all firms used straightline depreciation. Collapse"
101302,1990,review of economics and statistics,durable asset depreciation:  a reconciliation between hypotheses,durable asset depreciation a reconciliation between hypotheses,"Previous analyses of depreciation have resulted in conflicting claims and evidence concerning the depreciation patterns of durable assets. We demonstrate that heterogeneity in asset quality and usage rates can reconcile disparate results. Specifically, we add both usage and care to the flexible estimation model of Hulten and Wykoff (1981a). By accounting for systematic changes in these additional dimensions and controlling for sample bias and scrappage value, a near-geometric pattern emerges which can otherwise be obscured. The impact of usage (as distinct from age) has implications for the measurement of cost (and hence productivity) and for modeling replacement decisions. Studies measuring the total capital stock and its implied service flows are numerous in the economic literature (Jorgenson, 1971). An accurate measurement of the aggregate capital stock is often essential in analyses of investment. consumption. and productivity at the firm, regional and national levels. But measurement of the stock is difficult, owing to heterogeneity of both the capital stock and how it is used. Also critical is measuring how the capital depreciates as it ages. Despite its importance and the amount of research conducted on depreciation, no clear consensus exists about the depreciation patterns followed by different types of capital goods. Jorgenson and his associates have advocated the use of a geometric depreciation pattern in studies of investment behavior. In addition, several analyses of market data for used capital assets appear to support the geometric pattern, which implies a constant depreciation rate (see Hulten and Wykoff (1981a, b); Wykoff (1989); Hall (1971)). A number of articles have been written challenging the constant rate assumption as both implausible and misleading. Feldstein and Rothschild (1974), for example, point to the unrealistic requirements for asset decay and replacement that are necessary for a geometric pattern. Penson, Hughes, and Nelson (1977) suggest that the rapid decline in productive capacity immediately after purchase is inconsistent with the physical capacity of individual assets.

101303,1990,review of economics and statistics,on some sample path properties of intra-day futures prices,on some sample path properties of intra day futures prices,"This paper develops a time-series model for continuous time asset prices and then uses tick-by-tick data from Treasury bill futures to develop both a definition and test for efficiency in the continuous time case. The results suggest that intra-day data on futures prices do not behave like a Markov Renewal process; rather, lagged values of futures prices do have some predictive power. In addition, trading times are not useful in predicting futures prices. Finally, we estimate the bid-ask spread and show that even after adjusting for this spread, the serial dependence between current and lagged returns remains. The multitude of studies concerning efficiency in futures markets support the proposition that a Martingale approximation is reasonable for most commodity and capital asset markets, while the same data reject Gaussian processes as an appropriate model.1 All of these studies, however, use either close to close prices or open to open prices in the estimation process. The choice of daily data is arbitrary; a natural question concerns whether, based on continuous time data, futures prices can be shown to be realizations of continuous time Markov processes and whether they can be represented as stochastically linear processes. In this paper, we use intra-day, tick-by-tick, data on Treasury bills futures and develop both a definition and a test for efficiency in the continuous time case. Observations on continuous time prices yield two separate time series: the trading prices and times. As a result, we claim that the standard procedures for tests of market efficiency must be replaced by two separate necessary conditions; the first is the usual condition that successive price changes are independent; the second requires that the recurrence times between trades obey a Poisson process. We apply the above definitions to intra-day futures prices for Treasury bills for a 57 day period in 1983. The results indicate that the Markov model does not hold for intra-day futures prices but the trading times do seem to behave approximately as a Poisson process.

All researchers agree that women commute shorter distances to work than men. In addition, some researchers have argued from indirect evidence that two-earner households give greater weight to husbands' job opportunities when choosing a residential location. In this paper, we use data on two-earner households from the 1980 Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) of the US Census for the Detroit and Philadelphia SMSAs to quantify the effects of residential location and of gender differences in commuting behaviour on the gender gap in wages. First, we find that within white households wives encounter relatively greater spatial variation in wages than their husbands but that there is less of a gender difference among black households. Second, we analyse the simultaneous effects of commuting and residential constraints on wages. We find for both cities, and for both blacks and whites, that the gender wage gap is not changed in any significant way by altering women's intrametropolitan residential and job locations. Collapse"

In order to qualify for external loans and aid for such redevelopment efforts and to ensure the replicability of such projects, the principles of cost-recovery and cost effectiveness have been advocated. Many World Bank assissted urban development projects have been implemented, based on these principles. Unfortunately, these principles have become difficult or perhaps impossible to achieve in most of the past urban development ventures. Our hypothesis is that the abject poverty of the people and a wrong assessment of what the beneficiaries can afford may be the most important factors which make the principles unrealisable. The case study from Ibadan, Nigeria, reported in this article, confirms this hypothesis. The paper explores the capacity and the willingness of people to pay for urban improvement programmes. The study reveals that poverty is a major constraint to urban redevelopment in Nigeria. The people are found to be willing and able to contribute more in kind than in cash to urban redevelopment efforts.

101478,1990,urban studies,mid-wales:  choosing the right perspectives,mid wales   choosing the right perspectives,"The primary objective of Mid-Wales Development (MWD) is to halt the outward net flow of population. The 1981 census revealed an upward turn in population, and MWD aims to continue this upward trend and to encourage young people to remain in the area (Mid-Wales Development, 1986) . Recent developments in the economy of Mid-Wales to fulfil this objective are eloquently described by Day and Hedger (1990), who also quintessentially advocate the case for future development to continue the process . It is important to establish how the analysis of the performance of the MidWales economy should be advanced, and how MWD's contribution should be assessed. A broad view of performance is suggested by Day and Hedger (1990), covering such items as job creation, stability of employment, type of employment, quality of training, level of skills and reduction in unemployment, as well as the distribution of development throughout the settlement pattern and the promotion of cultural identity and national and international reputation in the Welsh heartland. Of course development can be defined as embracing all of these items, and should be regarded as more than just job creation. However, the study by Willis et al. (1986), reported in Willis and Saunders (1988), restricted the analysis of the impact of MWD's advance factory programme, 1981-85, to that on employment, primarily because this was the brief given by MWD for the study! It should not be suggested that employment is the only development benefit provided by MWD, but only that it may be one of the easier items to measure! The difficulty in quantifying other development items is reflected in Day and Hedger's arguments about what they perceive to be serious shortcomings in MWD's operations . But leaving aside judgemental issues on the process by which Mid-Wales should develop and the strategy MWD should adopt, e.g. growth centres versus a wider spread of development, manufacturing versus service-based employment, concentration of administrative functions versus dispersion, employment for in-migrants versus local population, etc ., three particular methodological issues in the paper by Day and Hedger are worthy of discussion : Collapse"

The three levels of dimension 1 correspond to the three factors emergent from a factor analysis of the predictor variables. These are labelled as representing either economic level, demographic composition or social features of the towns. Dimension 2 was a priori defined as being dichotomous, as it represented each variable's enhancing (a positive β-coefficient) or inhibiting (a negative β-coefficient) effect on intra-urban migration rates. Six cells result from the intersection of the two dimensions. Multivariate regression analysis is carried out within each level of the two dimensions. Regression analysis within the inhibitor level of dimension 1 reveals that four variables inhibited urban residential change: home-ownership, relatively high income, religiosity level of the town and median age of the town's population. These variables are distributed among the three levels of dimension 2. These results partially parallel findings concerning inmigration to Israeli towns that economic variables are crucial to locational decisions.

101505,1990,world development,the structural adjustment of politics in africa,the structural adjustment of politics in africa,"Recurring civil conflicts in Africa demonstrate reference behaviors that may be explained through integrative causal mechanisms and dynamic feedback processes between peacekeeping, aid, and development interventions at the nexus between security and development. In previous work, I have demonstrated a theoretically grounded approach for combining individual agency and system-level dynamics at the nexus of security-development policy domains for evaluating impact of interventions on resiliency of various actors in instances of recurring armed civil conflict. My theoretical model incorporates individual agency with system dynamics to operationalize a resiliency framework for policy analysis of interventions by regional and international actors. This model has been further developed and tested in an in-depth case study of conflict in Somalia from 1990 to the present day, based on field work in East Africa with government representatives, soldiers, aid workers, and development specialists in six different countries. Important new feedback loops discovered through field interviews help to explain recurring conflict and the sensitivity of combatant as well as societal resiliency to different vectors for implementing intervention strategies. These insights are extrapolated to hypothesize what leads to the three different representative system behaviors for civil conflict, and how data from recent cases in Africa map to these behaviors. Persistent armed intrastate civil conflicts in the developing world present threats to global security interests that raise difficult policy questions of when and how third party interventions achieve their objectives -­‐-­‐ considering normative, material, economic, and political factors. In recent years, scholarly research has improved understanding of the macro-­‐level conditions under which political instability is likely to break out, the dynamics of conflict escalation due to repression and instrumental violence, and the factors that impact conflict duration and termination. However, the ability to accurately predict where and when political instability will erupt into violent civil conflict, and what policies will be most effective to prevent conflict, are elusive goals of both academic and policy communities. In recent years, more than 200 independent variables have been quantitatively explored in the literature using cross-­‐country comparative analyses to improve understanding of the conditions that pose the highest risk of political instability and armed civil conflict. There is some degree of consensus on the significance of fewer than thirty of these variables, and a high degree of consensus on no more than seven (Dixon, 2009; Sambanis, 2002). Discrepancies and inconsistencies around contested variables are most commonly attributed to different theoretical frameworks, data limitations, lack of methods for exploring complex interaction effects between variables, different methods used to operationalize measurements, and scaling effects (Buhaug & Lujala, 2005; Collier & Hoeffler, 2001; Dixon, 2009; Sambanis, 2002). At the country level, highest risk of conflict and instability is generally agreed to be strongly and positively correlated to conditions of poverty coupled with a large population (but not population growth or density), economic contraction, weak government institutions and infrastructures (especially in anocracies or partial democracies), heavy reliance of the export sector on primary commodities, political change, and a recent history of armed conflict (Collier & Hoeffler, 2004, 2005; Collier, Hoeffler, & Sambanis, 2005; Collier & Sambanis, 2005; Dixon, 2009; Fearon, 2005; Gates, Hegre, Jones, & Strand, 2006; Goldstone et al., 2010; Ross, 2006). As a result, humanitarian aid and economic development are often pursued as part of conflict prevention strategies. In a world of shrinking resources, however, the linkage between security and development is an ongoing area of research. While some general, common themes have been developed, consensus around causal mechanisms and policy solutions is lacking (Tschirgi, Lund, & Mancini, 2010). Three types of connections between security and development dominate the literature: security as an objective of development, security as an instrument in achieving development goals, and development as an instrument for achieving security goals (Stewart, 2004). Broad conclusions linking thematic and case studies suggest that these connections cannot be considered independenlty of one another (Paul Collier, 2003; Tschirgi et al., 2010): 1. Structural development factors invariably introduce risks of intrastate conflict -­‐ although the patterns are different depending on context. 2. At country level, political uncertainty and instability emerge as causes rather than consequences of development failures and insecurity (and therefore provide a key to their remedy). There is a security-­‐politics-­‐development nexus that is highly context specific. 3. External factors, both regional and international, have such influence that country level factors alone cannot explain conflict and development nor provide solutions . The causal loop diagram shown in Figure 1, based on on the Collier-­‐Hoffman model of the so-­‐called “Conflict Trap”, illustrates the interdependencies between these broad conclusions. In addition to the need for better understanding of these system dynamics, there is a gap in understanding conflict dynamics at the micro-­‐level, and how those dynamics interact with interventions at the sub-­‐national level to effect macro-­‐level conflict dynamics. The lack of understanding is evidenced by two disturbing trends regarding civil conflict: (1) in spite of a substantial decline in the number of armed civil conflicts over the past two decades and increasing levels of external intervention, today’s Figure 1 Causal loop diagram of key factors causing conflict in the Collier-­‐Hoeffler model civil conflicts last longer than in the past and result in higher deficits in human security;1 and (2) today’s civil conflicts are increasingly likely to re-­‐occur after wars stop -­‐ with around half of civil wars being due to post-­‐conflict relapses. Present-­‐day examples can be found across multiple continents and diverse geo-­‐political and conflict settings that include Myanmar (Burma), India, Pakistan, Thailand, the Philippines, Iraq, Afghanistan, Mali, South Sudan, Yemen, Central African Republic, the DRC, Nigeria, and Somalia. Data on violent events/year in Africa from 1997-2014 seems to indicate that the thematic conclusions linking security and development are valid. Moreover, the data suggests that one of four reference behaviors characteristic of system dynamics describe most of the patterns seen in 1 Human security concerns the protection and wellbeing of individuals and communities, in contrast to more 2 Data is from the Armed Conflict Location and Event database (Raleigh, Linke, Hegre, & Karlsen, 2010) the countries experiencing significant armed conflict during that time period.

Additional explanatory variables are foreign student enrollment in the United States, lagged immigration, total immigration from each country, and a dummy variable which accounts for implementation of restrictions on permanent visas in 1972–1973. Results generally conform to expectations, but differ across occupations and with model specification. Most income statistics are unexpected, however, and the strong correlation of US income with graduation in the United States suggests that there is a simultaneity problem in models which include income. Because immigration appears to respond to labor shortages in the United States and surpluses in countries of origin, our results suggest that US immigration quotas have not prevented Third World professionals from responding to economic incentives.

This article presents an alternative, interactive model of implementation that focuses on the conflict and reactions that are evoked by efforts to bring about changed policy or institutional contexts for development, and the resources that policy makers and managers are likely to require to sustain a reform in the face of such reactions. Central to the analysis is the assertion that characteristics of the reform being implemented will largely determine the kind of conflict it engenders, where such reaction is likely to become manifest, and what resources are needed for sustainability. The analysis suggests a framework for the strategic management of reform initiatives. Collapse"

Sour orange (Citrus aurantium L.) seedlings were treated for 4 months with a nutrient solution containing either no NaCl, 40 mM NaCI, or 40 mM NaCl plus various concen- trations of CaSO 4, CaCl 2, or KCl. After 4 months, the NaCl alone reduced root and shoot dry weights by ≈ 30% with no leaf necrosis. Addition of 1, 5, or 7.5 m M CaSO4 to solutions containing 40 mM NaCl significantly inhibited the NaCl-induced reductions in shoot dry weight. Addition of 7.5 mM CaCl2 or 7 mM KCl to the NaCl solution reduced leaf Na, but increased Cl to the toxicity level; hence, growth was not improved. The beneficial effect of CaSO4 was mainly attributed to a reduction in the accumulation of Na and Cl below the toxicity level in the leaves (0.4% and 0.5%, respectively) without a major increase in total dissolved salts. This study demonstrated that the beneficial effect of adding Ca depended on the anion associated with the Ca salt.

101563,1990,american economic review,input market price discrimination and the choice of technology,input market price discrimination and the choice of technology,"Recent concerns over the effects of the Robinson-Patman Act' and so-called priceprotection policies such as most-favoredcustomer clauses (MFC's)2 on market performance have given economists new reasons to examine the welfare effects of third-degree price discrimination. In order to assess these effects correctly, it is imperative that one understand how price discrimination influences market behavior. Joan Robinson's (1933) work launched the formal inquiry into the welfare effects of third-degree price discrimination. Building on the intuition presented by Arthur Pigou (1932), she showed that, if a monopolist faces two independent linear demand curves, the use of price discrimination will not affect industry output but will reduce welfare. Richard Schmalensee (1981) extends these results to nonlinear demand curves and shows that an increase in total industry output is a necessary condition for price discrimination to be welfare improving. Hal Varian (1985) broadens these results by deriving upper and lower bounds on the welfare change due to the use of price discrimination. He shows that these results can be applied to markets in which there are nonzero cross price effects. All of this work examines how the ability of a monopolist to price-discriminate will affect the market outcome when all other characteristics of the market are treated as exogenous. Recently, two lines of research have extended this inquiry beyond the case of a monopolist in a market with exogenously fixed parameters. The first line considers the case of oligopoly. The work of Charles Holt and David Scheffman (1985) and Thomas Cooper (1986) has shown that restrictions on price discrimination imposed by the use of MFC's can facilitate collusion between oligopolists attempting to restrict output. This implies that third-degree price discrimination can be welfare-improving. The second line of research shows that price discrimination by a firm can affect nonprice decisions made by other market participants, thus affecting the market outcome. Michael Katz (1987) presents a model in which a large firm's ability to vertically integrate backward into the production of an input allows it to obtain a lower per-unit price from the supplier of the input than can be obtained by smaller firms without this ability. He shows that third-degree price discrimination reduces welfare unless it prevents inefficient backward integration. DeGraba (1987) shows that the use or nonuse of price discrimination by a national firm can affect nonprice decisions made by local firms that compete with the national firm. In this situation, third-degree price discrimination is welfare-reducing, because it induces local firms to produce a product that is ""overly differentiated"" from the product of the national firm. In all of the work cited above, price discrimination is important when sellers set prices in separate markets or charge different prices to different customers in the same market. The following analysis (which can be considered a contribution to the second line of research) suggests that price discrimination can be important even when a seller faces a single market in which all customers are identical. The intuition behind this result is that nonprice decisions made by downstream producers (such as the choice of technology) can be affected by the use or *Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853.

101568,1990,american economic review,auction institutional design:  theory and behavior of simultaneous multiple-unit generalizations of the dutch and english auctions,auction institutional design   theory and behavior of simultaneous multiple unit generalizations of the dutch and english auctions,"Historically, English and Dutch auctions have been used for the exchange of single objects such as works of art or single lots of a good such as produce, fish, or cut flowers. Where these institutions have been used for the exchange of multiple units, such as the Australian wool auction (using English rules), successive lots of the good are sometimes sold sequentially at auction. In some, but not all, instances this is because the goods are not identical, even though the various lots may be close substitutes (see Penny Burns, 1985). Where the goods are accepted universally as being homogeneous, as in the securities markets, multiple units are often commonly auctioned simultaneously. In the securities industry, orders are batched for simultaneous execution in multiple-unit auctions in what are referred to as ""call markets""; that is, the security is ""called"" for auction at a particular point in time. This type of market is used on the stock exchanges of Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, and Israel. Some of these are verbal, and some are sealed bid auctions. Although the U.S. organized exchanges are predominantly continuous rather than call markets (except that call markets are used each day to open trading in each listed security), there is a growing number of exceptions such as the proliferation, since 1984, of Auction Preferred Stock (Goldman, Sachs and Co., October 1984) and Money Market Preferred Stock (Lehman Brothers, July 1984). We now have Dutch Auction Rate Transferable Securities, called DARTS, Stated Rate Auction Preferred Stock, or STRAPS, and many more. After the initial subscription offering of this type of security, the market is called every 49 days to reset the preferred dividend rate using a multiple-unit auction. The exchange of shares and the dividend determination is based on the array of stated dividend rates at which existing holders and potential new holders are willing to sell and/or buy corresponding quantities. The dividend rate and exchange of shares every 49 days is executed using the uniform price or competitive sealed bid mechanism (Vernon L. Smith et al., 1980). The discussion to follow will be confined to this sealed bid form of the call market. Call markets provide temporal consolidation of trade orders or other forms of expressing the desire to buy and sell. By comparison with continuous trading, call markets offer both advantages and disadvantages (Robert A. Schwartz, 1988 pp. 442-6). The cited advantages include low cost of operating the exchange; information aggregation and presumed pricing efficiency; price stability; individual trades, which are thought to have a small impact on price; reduced price uncertainty; and, finally, nondiscriminatory pricing. However, there are offsetting disadvantages: (1) the market is inaccessible except at the time of call; (2) no bid, offer, contract, or price information is available until the results of the call are announced; and (3) there is transaction uncertainty because a submitted bid (offer) may be too low (high) to execute inside the supply-demand cross. These conditions are only partially alleviated if there is a secondary market between calls. These disadvantages may be significant. In September 1988, the Wall Street Journal published an article on the failure of a call market for the auction rate preferred stock *Economic Science Laboratory, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.

This suggests — though it does not imply — that prices of goods and services are as high or higher in larger cities than in smaller cities. But is this really so? And if so, does this imply that costs of distribution (and of the production of services) are higher in bigger cities?The relationship of prices to the sizes of cities is examined for 193 individual goods and services and for 23 broad groups. Price alone does not indicate efficiency. It is well-established that wages for the same work at given skill levels are higher in larger cities. Therefore, the total real inputs may be lower in a larger city, even if price is higher, which indicates better efficiency in larger cities. Study of individual goods and services, and of groupings of them, enables us to go beyond prices to learn which categories are offered more efficiently and which less efficiently in larger cities. We find that for most goods, economic cost decreases rather than increases with city size. Collapse"

In the 1970s density rose steadily, making the United Kingdom the most heavily organized large OECD country. In the 1980s, by contrast, density fell by 1.4 percentage points per annum -- a faster drop than in the rapidly de-unionizing U.S. or in Japan. What explains this turnaround - the severe recession of the 1980s? Shifts in the composition of employment from unionized manufacturing to services? The Thatcher government's industrial relations legislation? In this paper we investigate these questions with a quantitative analysis of 1945-1986 changes in British union density. In contrast to studies that concentrate on cyclical determinants of unionism (Bain and Elshiekh, Carruth and Disney, Booth (1983)) we focus on industrial relations legislation. We develop an index of the favorableness of labor laws to unionism and relate it to changes in density in time series regressions that control for inflation, unemployment, and the manufacturing share of employment, among other variables. As a further test, we develop an analogous labor law index for Ireland, whose industrial relations system is similar to the U.K.'s and which experienced a similar severe 1980s recession but which did not pass new laws to weaken unions, and contrast changes in density between the countries with differences in industrial relations law. Our major finding is that the Thatcher government's labor laws caused much of the 1980s fall in British union density. We present the evidence for this claim in three stages. Section 1 lays out the facts of changing union density in the U.K. and Ireland and examines structural explanations of the U.K. changes. Section 2 discusses the 1980s U.K. labor laws and develops an index of their likely impact on unionism. Section 3 presents our econometric analysis of the U.K. time series data. Collapse"

This paper analyses these policies in an institutional framework informed by the results of a recent research project on youth activity in industry in major EC economies (Marsden and Ryan 1986, 1988, 1989, 1991). The policy debate in Britain has tended to focus upon the effectiveness of lower youth pay at improving youth access to jobs and training (Wells 1983; Jones 1985; Junankar and Neale 1987). We accept the efficacy of lower youth pay but question its institutional viability. Youth employment and training policies must be well grounded in labour market institutions in order to achieve success. We argue that neglect of the institutional context accounts for the lopsided and partial success resulting from current policies in Britain, and that the revitalization of apprenticeship, either as such or in the equivalent form of a strongly upgraded public training scheme, has a great deal to offer. We begin with an outline of the relevant institutions. We trace their implications for outcomes in the youth market, contrast the divergent institutional directions taken by West Germany and the UK, and finally assess contemporary British policy towards youth activity in general and apprenticeship in particular.

Based on calendar data on contraceptive use over a 3-year period, collected for more than 3,000 married women in a 1986 survey, the multivariate analysis shows that women who attain all or a significant proportion of their desired fertility tend to switch to more effective methods. Women who experience method failure tend to switch methods, usually to a type that is more effective. The woman’s background determinants of age and education have small but significant effects on method switching, whereas the effect of household economic well-being is not significant. There is strong indication that rural couples are practicing contraception in a nonrandom fashion, switching methods in accordance with changes in their fertility motivations and contraceptive experience.

101898,1990,demography,residential preferences and population redistribution: 1972-1988,residential preferences and population redistribution  1972 1988,"In this article we examine the extent to which three minority groups were able to achieve selected neighborhood social and physical outcomes in the San Francisco mnetropolitan area. Ecological regressions were estimated to generate elasticities that measure the relative abilities of blacks, Hispanics, and Asians to convert education and income into desirable neighborhood environments. These regressions were interpreted in light of substantial differences between the three groups in levels of residential segregation. Results generally indicated a black disadvantage in the process of residential achievement, but it was not as dramatic as that found in earlier studies or as great as the levels of segregation would suggest. As in prior research, education was found to be the critical variable in explaining spatial differentiation and class stratification among blacks. In the United States, residences are allocated to persons and families through private housing markets. Since public housing comprises less than 2% of the nation's housing stock, and less than 1% of its housing starts (Adams 1987), virtually all households seeking a new residence enter the rental or sale market. Each household has a set of housing needs and desires based on its size, composition, life-cycle stage, and tastes; it also has a set of economic resources with which to achieve these desires, principally capital assets and income. Markets allocate households to specific residences through the mechanism of price; households purchase or rent the home that best suits their needs at the price they can afford (Berry & Rees 1969). According to neoclassic economic theory, the price of housing reflects the balance between aggregate demand and supply within local markets (Alonso 1964; Mills 1972). Researchers have pointed out, however, that housing is different from other commodities, and that these differences structure housing markets in distinct ways. First, residences are immobile; they are tied to a particular piece of land and cannot easily be consumed elsewhere (Logan & Molotch 1987). Second, they represent a very significant investment for most families, and for homeowners are the primary means of capital accumulation *Direct correspondence to the authors at the Population Research Center, University of Chicago, 1155 E. 60th Street, Chicago, IL 60637. i) The University of North Carolina Press Social Forces, September 1990, 69(1):15-32 This content downloaded from 157.55.39.104 on Mon, 20 Jun 2016 06:09:10 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms 16 / Social Forces 69:1, September 1990 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1986). Third, each residence is not only tied to a particular plot of land, it is also bound to a specific neighborhood (Massey et al. 1987) and, in turn, to a larger municipality (Logan 1978). Moreover, each geographic unit is associated with a social environment defined by the behaviors of residents and the service benefits provided by local government (Schneider & Logan 1982, 1985; Massey et al. 1987). Finally, houses, and the communities in which they are found, are more than mere commodities; they are also objects of powerful sentiments that influence judgments and condition decisions (Logan & Molotch 1987). In recognition of the fact that housing is immobile and linked to particular places, Charles Tiebout (1956) proposed a ""pure theory of local expenditures"" to account for the differentiated residential structure of cities. The theory rests on two key assumptions that households are free to move, and that places compete to attract them. Local governments offer different packages of tax costs, service benefits, and zoned environments from which home seekers choose. Over time, market competition produces a variety of service-tax-environment mixes and distributes households among them according to income, preferences, and wealth, yielding a residential structure differentiated by socioeconomic status, family life-cycle stage, race, and ethnicity. Although Tiebout's model recognizes some unique features of housing markets, it does not incorporate the fact that housing costs, and particularly home-ownership costs, reflect a substantial investment for families, or that homes, neighborhoods, and communities are the focus of strong emotional attachments. These traits give rise to what Stinchcombe (1965) calls ""communities of fate,"" where residents and institutions have large stakes not only in their own property, but in the property and characteristics of people in surrounding areas, making collective action highly likely. This propensity for collective action segments housing markets along social lines, so that individual choices are constrained by institutional practices and the collective behavior of others (Logan & Molotch 1987). The segmentation of housing markets, and the constraints it imposes on individual home seekers, are well illustrated by the case of U.S. blacks. The Tiebout model and its successors (Bish 1971; Peterson 1981) assume that households are free to move wherever their tastes and economic resources take them. Given this assumption, racial segregation is interpreted simply as the coincidental by-product of sorting based on income, wealth, and tastes (viz. Clark 1986). Considerable evidence, however, indicates that segregation does not stem from black preferences or low black-income levels. Public opinion polls show that blacks strongly endorse the principle of residential integration (Schuman et al. 1985) and express a clear preference for living in integrated neighborhoods, other things being equal (Farley et al. 1978). In spite of these tastes for integration, however, desegregation does not follow from the simple acquisition of socioeconomic resources sufficient to support spatial mobility. As education, income, and occupation rise, black-white segregation does not decline, but persists at a very high level (MIassey 1979, 1981; Denton & Massey 1988). Rather than reflecting tastes or socioeconomic status, black segregation appears to stem from constraints to black residential mobility imposed by the This content downloaded from 157.55.39.104 on Mon, 20 Jun 2016 06:09:10 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms Segregation and Neighborhood Quality / 17 collective behavior and institutional actions of whites. Studies of the real estate industry, for example, indicate that discrimination and prejudice are still widespread. Real estate agents systematically steer black home seekers away from white neighborhoods, and provide them less favorable treatment than whites (Molotch 1972; Pearce 1976; Wienk et al. 1979; Yinger 1986), actions which have been linked analytically to high levels of residential segregation (Galster 1986). At the same time, lending institutions have been found to finance a disproportionately small number of loans in black neighborhoods, even after objective social and economic factors are controlled (Taggart & Smith 1981; Pol et al. 1982; Leahy 1985). Moreover, in the few cases where blacks succeed in entering a white neighborhood, they are frequently met by organized white resistance and hostility (Hirsch 1983; Cass 1986; Bauman 1987), especially in working-class areas (Logan & Stearns 1981; Stearns & Logan 1986a); and if blacks succeed in establishing themselves, the neighborhood is quite likely to be avoided by subsequent white home seekers, resulting in eventual resegregation (Massey & Mullan 1984). Thus, the collective action of white residents and the institutional practices in the real estate and banking industries bifurcate urban housing markets along racial lines, fostering high levels of segregation despite a strong demand by blacks for integration. Some studies suggest that Hispanics face similar barriers, but to a lesser degree (Hakken 1979; James & Tynan 1986). The effect of a racially segmented housing market in creating and sustaining segregation is crucial to understanding the socioeconomic position of blacks in the United States. Barriers to spatial mobility are, in a very real way, barriers to social mobility. As Logan and Molotch (1987:49) point out, socioeconomic inequality among households and geographic inequality among places are not independent; the two systems of hierarchy reinforce one another: ""High status within the social hierarchy can bring access to the most desirable places ... and a guarantee of a rewarding future for whatever place one controls. At the same time a high status for one's geographical place means the availability of resources . . . that enhance life chances generally."" In a similar vein, Giddens (1980:107-12) argues that segregation is a core mechanism of class structuration, since it concentrates people of low status in space and ensures the maintenance of behaviors and orientations detrimental to success in the larger society. In this article we demonstrate how segregation structures the neighborhood environment achieved by three minority groups in one large urban area. We estimate the degree to which blacks, Hispanics, and Asians are able to convert socioeconomic achievements into selected neighborhood outcomes within the San Francisco-Oakland Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1980. The analysis proceeds in three phases. First, we establish the degree of segregation experienced by blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in the San Francisco SMSA. We then consider the extent to which the degree of segregation faced by each group affects its ability to convert status attainments into neighborhood social outcomes. Finally, we evaluate the degree to which each group is able to convert status attainments into different physical characteristics of the neighborhood environment.

Conversely, a series of recent process and technological innovations have provided effective and efficient options to reach the most deprived populations. These trends raise the possibility that the perceived trade-off between equity and efficiency no longer applies for child health--that prioritising services for the poorest and most marginalised is now more effective and cost effective than mainstream approaches. We tested this hypothesis with a mathematical-modelling approach by comparing the cost-effectiveness in terms of child deaths and stunting events averted between two approaches (from 2011-15 in 14 countries and one province): an equity-focused approach that prioritises the most deprived communities, and a mainstream approach that is representative of current strategies. We combined some existing models, notably the Marginal Budgeting for Bottlenecks Toolkit and the Lives Saved Tool, to do our analysis. We showed that, with the same level of investment, disproportionately higher effects are possible by prioritising the poorest and most marginalised populations, for averting both child mortality and stunting. Our results suggest that an equity-focused approach could result in sharper decreases in child mortality and stunting and higher cost-effectiveness than mainstream approaches, while reducing inequities in effective intervention coverage, health outcomes, and out-of-pocket spending between the most and least deprived groups and geographic areas within countries. Our findings should be interpreted with caution due to uncertainties around some of the model parameters and baseline data. Further research is needed to address some of these gaps in the evidence base. Strategies for improving child nutrition and survival, however, should account for an increasing prioritisation of the most deprived communities and the increased use of community-based interventions.

For the leading cases of conditional mean and/or conditional variance tests, the proposed statistics are robust to departures from distributional assumptions that are not being tested, while maintaining asymptotic efficiency under ideal conditions. Moreover, the statistics can be computed using any √ T -consistent estimator, resulting in significant simplifications in some otherwise difficult contexts. Among the examples covered are conditional mean tests for models estimated by weighted nonlinear least squares under misspecification of the conditional variance, tests of jointly parameterized conditional means and variances estimated by quasi-maximum likelihood under nonnormality, and some robust specification tests for a dynamic linear model estimated by two-stage least squares.

Surprisingly, no modifications to the formulas given in [22] are required. The limit laws are expressed in terms of ratios of quadratic functional of a stable process rather than Brownian motion.

However, the resulting estimates of derivatives, as well as parameter estimates and inferences that depend on the derivatives, can be highly sensitive to the choice of the kernel and finite difference bandwidths.

We also show how an estimator that attains this lower bound can be constructed, via nonparametric estimation of the conditional density at zero of the disturbance. As a special case our results apply to the (uncensored) linear model under a conditional median restriction. Collapse"

Our approach is based on a combination of the ARMA memory index modeling approach of Bierens [7] with a modification to time series of the nonparametric kernel regression approach of Devroye and Wagner [16]. This approach is truly model-free, as no explicit specification of the distribution of the data generating process is needed. Collapse"

101958,1990,econometric theory,testing for a moving average unit root,testing for a moving average unit root,"This paper develops univariate seasonal unit root tests based on spectral regression estimators. An advantage of the frequency domain approach is that it enables serial correlation to be treated non-parametrically. We demonstrate that our proposed statistics have pivotal limiting distributions under both the null and near seasonally integrated alternatives when we allow for weak dependence in the driving shocks. This is in contrast to the popular seasonal unit root tests of, among others, Hylleberg et al. (1990) which treat serial correlation parametrically via lag augmentation of the test regression. Our analysis allows for (possibly infinite order) moving average behaviour in the shocks. The size and power properties of our proposed frequency domain regression-based tests are explored and compared for the case of quarterly data with those of the tests of Hylleberg et al. (1990) in simulation experiments. Collapse"
101959,1990,econometric theory,functional forms of characteristic functions and characterizations of multivariate distributions,functional forms of characteristic functions and characterizations of multivariate distributions,"During the Oxford Conference of the Econometric Society in 1936, Ragnar Frisch proposed a problem of characterization of distributions based on the property of linear regression of one linear function of random variables on the other. This problem has been solved, partially by Allen [1], and then completely by Rao [24,25], Fix [7], and Laha [13] relaxing the conditions imposed on the component random variables. The purpose of this paper is to solve the above mentioned problem for the multivariate case, characterizing multivariate distributions based on the multivariate linear regression of one linear function of not necessarily i.i.d. random vectors with matrix coefficients on the other. We make some mild assumptions concerning the component random vectors and the related constant matrices. It is shown that the property of multivariate linear regression yields a system of partial differential equations (p.d.e.'s) satisfied by the characteristic functions of the component random vectors. A general solution of this system of p.d.e.'s is given by certain functional forms. Special cases of the general solution give characterizations of the “multivariate generalized stable laws” and the multivariate semistable laws, and a method is presented to characterize the multivariate stable laws.

AIR models are nonparametric regression models that generalize additive regression models by allowing interactions between different regressor variables. They place more restrictions on the regression function, however, than do fully nonparametric regression models. By doing so, they attempt to circumvent the curse of dimensionality that afflicts the estimation of fully nonparametric regression models. In this paper, we present a finite sample bound and asymptotic rate of convergence results for the mean average squared error of series estimators that show the AIR models do circumvent the curse of dimensionality. The rate of convergency of these estimators is shown to depend on the order of the AIR model and the smoothness of the regression function, but not on the dimension of the regressor vector. Series estimators with fixed and data-dependent truncation parameters are considered. Collapse"

Kai-Uwe Bux (Bielefeld University) Noncrossing partitions and classifying spaces for braid groups (after T. Brady) Let G be a group. A classifying space for G is a CW-complex with fundamental group G and contractible universal cover. This cover is a contractible CW-complex with a free action of G. Conversely, any such contractible free G-complex gives rise to a classifying space. Classifying spaces are unique up to homotopy equivalence and their homotopy type is an important topological invariant of the group. Searching within this homotopy type for particularly nice representatives is an important part of geometric group theory. In this commissioned talk, I shall consider the case where G is the braid group Bn on n strands. Tom Brady has constructed a particularly nice classifying space for this group making essential use of noncrossing partitions. I shall explain his construction.

Grigori Olshanski (Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow) Determinantal measures and Markov dynamics My two talks are based on joint work with Sergey Pirogov, [7]. We construct a model of Markov dynamics for a one-dimensional lattice gas system with infinitely many interacting particles. The model possesses a stationary distribution, which is a determinantal measure meaning that its correlation functions are given by principal minors of a kernel K(x, y) on the lattice. (About determinantal measures, see e.g. Borodin [1], Soshnikov [8].) The kernel K(x, y) first appeared in Borodin–Olshanski [3]; it has the same general structure A(x)B(y)−B(x)A(y) x− y as the so-called integrable kernels from Random Matrix Theory. We call K(x, y) the Gamma kernel, because A and B are expressed through Euler’s Γ-function. In the equilibrium regime, reproducing the stationary distribution, the dynamical correlation functions of our dynamics also have determinantal form. That is, they are given by appropriate minors of an “extended” kernel K(x, s; y, t) with two space-time arguments, (x, s) and (y, t). The structure of this “extended Gamma kernel” is similar to that of the extended kernels from Random Matrix Theory (see Tracy–Widom [9]). The present work is related to previous works [4], [5], [6] by Borodin and myself, devoted to dynamical models for some continuous gas systems. Both continuous and lattice models in question originated from some problems of representation theory (see Borodin–Olshanski [2]). However, the methods used in the continuous case and in the lattice case are quite different. In the lattice case, our approach is based on a close connection between determinantal measures and their “noncommutative” analogs — quasifree states on the algebra CAR of canonical anticommutation relations.

101974,1990,econometrica,time consistency of fiscal and monetary policy:  a comment,time consistency of fiscal and monetary policy a comment,"IN AN IMPORTANT recent contribution, Persson, Persson, and Svensson (1987) (hereafter PPS) suggest that through careful restructuring of its nominal and real debt obligations, a government may be able to induce future governments to follow the monetary and fiscal policies that it regards as optimal today. The PPS argument builds on Lucas and Stokey's (1983) demonstration that in a special nonmonetary setting, the time inconsistency of optimal fiscal policy can be avoided through managing the term structure of real government obligations to the public. The basic idea of the PPS scheme for monetary economies is disarmingly intuitive: in addition to continually restructuring nominal and real debt obligations a la Lucas-Stokey, each government must ensure that the next government inherits a stream of nominal claims on the public whose present discounted value equals the stock of money. This equality, PPS argue, removes the incentive for surprise inflation or deflation, because such surprises would not affect the real net worth of the government. This note shows that the PPS prescription for avoiding time inconsistency, appealing as it is, is not generally sufficient. Even under the debt restructuring they recommend, optimal policy is likely to be time inconsistent. The main reason why their scheme fails is that the restrictions it imposes on government asset stocks satisfy first-order but not second-order conditions for an optimum. Because of the complex interactions between the current price level and future interest rates, a government can raise its objective function by moving several variables at once away from the levels planned by the previous government, even though price-level changes alone would not affect government net worth. We develop our argument using the model, notation, and equation numbers of PPS, to which the reader is referred for details. The maximization problem associated with Collapse"

In Latin America, physicians play a key role in social production and reproduction. This paper traces the loss of physician control over the conditions of their work since the turn of the century. Argentine and Uruguayan physicians manage to keep the medical industry free of government intervention that would reduce their income-earning potential. Medical care in both countries has responded to the forces of ethnicity, class, and changing medical technology. Bureaucratic complexity and numerous small medical programs allow physicians to hold down several jobs. The labor theory of value suggests that physician proletarianization is well underway in both countries. Specifically, a trend toward physician proletarianization is most evident in four key ways: the terms of criteria for entrance into the profession, autonomy regarding the terms and content of work, tools of labor, and the amount and rate of remuneration. The paper concludes that studies of physician production and reproduction in the Latin American city must go beyond ""doctor bashing"" if we are to understand the transformation of health care delivery.

Further, increasing inflation rates prior to the stabilization are compatible only with deficits that are lower than the maximal feasible staedy- state deficits, and with a stabilization program that reduces the demand for real balances.

Attfield, Demery and Duck (i 990), hereafter ADD, question the numerical accuracy of our labour income series (attributing our finding of a positive relationship between savings and the change in labour income to this inaccuracy), the appropriate theoretical measure of labour income, and the efficiency of our tests of the REPI.

The intention was less to produce a detailed statistical description of the current situation, than to gain an impression of how departments themselves saw the evolving trends, and how they proposed to deal with them. Questionnaire replies were received from 57 of the 75 institutions which offer single or joint honours degrees, and cross-checks with UGC and DCP sources indicated a coverage of over two-thirds of university economics graduates, and over 90g0 of those from polytechnics. From I 983 to i 987 the numbers of both graduates and entrants rose substantially. The average university department reported an increase of over 20% in admissions; the average polytechnic department, over a 250% rise. This expansion has now stopped and for the period from i988 to 1992 the average expected increase across both sectors is only 400. The survey shows that central government funding and the institutions' central decision-making apparatuses were equally the most important constraints on the growth of the subject.

For instance, it may mean balancing trade multilaterally, at whatever level of payments deficit or surplus one desires, as distinct from insisting on bilateral balancing with specific countries: the latter constituting a folly and a temptation that few politicians can resist but most economists will run from. But the two characteristics of the GATT-based multilateral trading system that spring to mind most readily to scholars of international trade, and which therefore I focus on here are, first the principle of non-discrimination, which implies the extension of MFN (mostfavoured nation) treatment to all GATT members; and second the principle that balanced, mutual, reciprocal concessions, and acceptance of new disciplines, amounting to 'first difference' reciprocity (Bhagwati, I988), be the method for achieving progressive movement toward free trade. This would rule out the aggressive use of power to extract either unrequited trade concessions or acceptance of new disciplines, therefore shielding the weak against the strong who would otherwise, in bilateral one-on-one confrontations, have an advantage constrained only by altruism or conscience. These principles are stated in idealised form. In reality, however, the GATT permits departures from MFN for (i) countervailing duties against foreign subsidies (CVD) and as anti-dumping (AD) measures aimed only at the offending parties (Article VI);' (2) developing countries (Part IV) who get Special and Differential treatment such as preferentially lower tariffs in developed countries that are GATT members, and (3) customs unions and free trade areas (Article XXIV).2 Collapse"

At the same time, they have equally been committed to special-and-differential (S & D) treatment for themselves under GATT rules. Their approach has been to argue that trade problems of developing countries are special from those of developed countries; balance-of-payments problems, viewed by them as endemic to low-income countries, make liberalisation difficult, and import substitution strategies suggest that liberalisation is, anyway, undesirable. Poor export prospects (export pessimism) imply they need different treatment from developed countries in order to grow; that is, trade preferences in developed country markets. Special and differential also became a bloc-wide strategy jointly pursued, reflecting the premise that developing countries are jointly and simultaneously special and differential in their trade problems. This is, however, changing. In the Uruguay Round developing countries have shown themselves remarkably adept at moving away from the earlier, somewhat passive, bloc-wide S & D approach. In a surprising range of negotiating groups, countries have actively pursued country over bloc-wide interests, and in an active way involving a willingness to take on new GATT disciplines. While S & D is far from having been abandoned as a principle of the trading system, the approach seems to be one of protecting and preserving what is there, rather than pushing for further enhancement. The reasons for these changes are, as always, multi-faceted. Strong growth performance in the more outward-oriented developing countries (Korea, and other NICs) has weakened the intellectual commitment to import substitution. What exactly S & D has yielded developing countries in concrete trade policy terms has also been queried. And over the years, the differences between developing countries (large/small, middle-income/least-developed, industrialised/commodity exports, agricultural importers/exporters, and others) have grown, to the point that in the Uruguay Round a grand coalition of all developing countries does not exist in any active sense.

102272,1990,energy economics,some general equilibrium effects of declining crude oil production in australia,some general equilibrium effects of declining crude oil production in australia,"Abstract Crude oil production in Australia is expected to decline significantly during the 1990s. As a result, net imports of crude oil could increase sharply over the period. In this paper, macroeconomic, intersectoral and interindustry effects of a fall in domestic crude oil production are examined. General equilibrium effects are estimated using ORANI, a large multisectoral model of the Australian economy. By itself, the reduction in crude oil production would require restraint in domestic expenditure and a decline in Australia's real exchange rate in order to offset the expected rise in net crude oil imports. Furthermore, a contraction of the domestic oil industry would result in a small decline in gross domestic produce together with an expansion of other import-competing and export industries. It is important to note that other changes in the energy sector, such as the substantial expected increase in production of coal, uranium and LNG over the next decade, have the potential to more than offset the macroeconomic effects of reduced oil production.

The model has been estimated in two stages. In the first stage input demand for various energy components is estimated and hence an aggregate Divisia index is constructed. In the second stage this index is used as an instrument to estimate aggregate input demand for capital, labour and energy along with their price and substitution elasticities. It seems that there is little interfuel substitution. The results also show that energy and labour are substitutes while energy and capital are complement. Collapse"

This issue is examined in a case study of a community in rural Washington State. The findings indicate that producer services have not been decentralizing to rural Washington, and that opportunities for producer services development in rural communities are limited because of the inaccessibility of markets, smaller pools of skilled labor, and the lack of agglomeration economies. Opportunities for producer services are greatest in large rural communities with high-quality telecommunications systems. Although the quality of telecommunications systems is important to the economic health of communities, advances in telecommunications can be a two-way street for rural America. While telecommunications improvements increase a rural community's access to information and make it possible for rural businesses to more easily serve non-local markets, they can also make it easier for firms located in urban areas to serve rural markets via branch offices or through the telecommunications system.

Parasites are touted as prime movers in the evolution of sex, promising the final solution to that problem of problems, the puzzle that led G. C. Williams to proclaim in 1975 ‘a kind of crisis’ at hand in evolutionary biology (Hamilton, 1980; Tooby, 1982; Seger & Hamilton, 1988). Parasites seem to offer a plausible justification for the otherwise futile effort females put into choosing among posturing males (Hamilton & Zuk, 1982; but see Read, 1990). Frequency-dependent selection exerted by parasites is, according to one admittedly minority view, largely responsible for the high levels of diversity found in gene pools (Clarke, 1979). One might even extrapolate to a time when the entire metazoan body could come to be seen as a gigantic adaptation against microscopic pathogens. Collapse"
102456,1990,inquiry,payment reform:  sizing up its wrinkles and implications,payment reform sizing up its wrinkles and implications,"Latin America and the Caribbean Region experienced dramatic changes in the 1990s. Politically, all but one country, are governed by a democratically elected government. Economically, import substitution industrialization policies (ISI) followed in the past, were replaced by liberalization programs aimed at reducing inflationary pressures and creating a competitive environment. The significant increase in capital flows to Latin America in one single year, 1990, buried the 1980s as the “lost decade,” and the successful implementation of privatization programs region-wide prompted to affirm that the 1990s might constitute the “Latin America's decade.” Where does the euphoria come from? Is there any implicit promise to be derived from such international capital flows? Will the pattern be sustained? Has Latin America begun a new era? Are unfolding events on defiance of fundamentals? These and many other questions can be raised regarding the spectacular transformation of Latin America and the Caribbean, particularly when analysts still debate about the Mexican crisis of 1994, investors eagerly pursue the agenda of a second privatization wave, experts around the world get fascinated with the high-tech push found in Latin America, bankers apply Latin American lessons to deal with the currency crisis in Asia, and casual observers recognize the value-creation process added by Latin American entrepreneurs who challenge the most adverse circumstances. Indeed, Latin America and the Caribbean is a land full of promises and contrasts, where there exists a head to head competition between globalization and nationalism, the haves and the have-nots, capitalism and communism, literature and high-technology, markets and governments, East and West, North and South, myth and reality, and … “despair and hope.” There is no question, however, that Latin America and the Caribbean, being she a detached wide-land, is a region of great opportunity. Since the external debt crisis of 1982 and its aftermath, democracy, open markets, economic reform and privatization have blended to offer great expectations and opportunities for business and investment in the region. The new vision strongly questioned the status quo to render a new business environment to open the doors and light up the roads of the upcoming millennium. It is the purpose of the International Journal of Public Administration to offer to its readers, for the very first time, a special issue devoted entirely to the discussion of the new business environment of Latin America and the Caribbean. We are, therefore, grateful to all the authors who generously are sharing with us the findings from their scholarly research. Given the far reaching consequences of their contributions, we, as guest editors of this special issue, had no other choice but to incorporate the fruits yielded by this symposium of thirty-seven papers in four issues in one single volume. The papers have been sorted according to the following four focal points: Privatization of State Owned Enterprises; Mexico; Economic, Financial and Foreign Investment Issues; and Economic Integration, Trade and Cultural Issues. Part I of this special issue on “The New Latin American Business Environment” looks at one element of the broad economic strategy followed by most Latin American countries: Privatization of State Owned Enterprises. The role of governments is to provide the framework that will allow the private sector to create wealth. Notwithstanding, this partnership between the public and private sectors must ensure the inclusion of the poorer sections of the population. In many ways, the long-term sustainability of these economic programs will largely depend on this. The ten papers selected for this part, provide insight on how this phenomenon is affecting different Latin American countries. The first paper by Shamsul Haque argues that there is a need to analyze the social consequences of privatization programs. Further research is needed to identify the main advocates and beneficiaries of privatization programs. According to the author, “critical economic conditions have not improved significantly after privatization, and in many instances, the conditions have deteriorated.” About fifty percent of Latin America's population of 470 million people live under poverty. The late Sister Martin Byrne (1) documents in her paper, “Cananea Consolidated Copper Company from Nationalization to Privatization: 1972-1991 ,” the problems of ownership and management faced by La Cananea, a Mexican copper mine. Sister Byrne argues that “The Cananea mines were profitable under entrepreneurial and MNC ownership, but proved to be a financial drain on the government during the paraestatal period.” The third paper by Garcia and Dyner, examined the reform and regulation of electricity in Columbia. According to the authors, the regulatory framework adopted by the government is going to determine the success of these programs. Furthermore, “the challenge is the change of public intervention in the sector, so that it regulates, supports, and supervises the decentralized activities of the firms, and liberates resources to be invested in other areas.” Walter and Gonzalez provide interesting philosophical arguments on technology and human resources management derived from the cases of privatized companies in Argentina. The authors consider two variants, “systemic modernization and revamping of existing teams” to invite a reopening of the old debate on technological blending. They argue, however, that “to compete you do not necessarily need to ‘ be on the frontier.’” Joan B. Anderson examines, the “Privatization, Efficiency and Market Failure: Transforming Ecuador's Public Sector,” privatization in Ecuador through the shift experienced by development theory with respect to the role of the public sector. In this paper the author points out that “while careful privatization can be positive, privatizing monopolies like the electric utility and/or quasi-public goods like highways are likely to be detrimental to long run economic development.” Doshi identifies the successes and failures of the privatization program in Mexico by analyzing the cases of Mexicana Airlines, Aeromexico and Telmex. The author argues that even though the government was able to sell a number of state owned enterprises, a “successful” privatization program required appropriate macroeconomic policies and defining the role of foreign investment in economic development. One can argue then, that even though the size of the state is shrinking, its role is becoming more important. The article by Vetter and Zanetta analyze also the case of Argentina. The authors argue that in order to consolidate the economic reforms implemented by the national government, provincial reform has to take place. A number of important lessons were identified. John M. Kirk and Julia Sagebien present, in “Cuba's Market Rapprochement: Private Sector Reform - Public Sector Style,” the highlights of Cuba's process of transition towards a market economy by analyzing the conditions that lead to a market opening as well as the ends, the means and the actors of the ensuing process of economic reform. Walter T. Molano contributes a paper, “The Lessons of Privatization,” based on his book The Logic of Privatization: The Case of Telecommunications in the Southern Cone of Latin America by looking at privatization as a process that may end up in varied outcomes as seen from microeconomic-, macroeconomic-, and political perspectives of analysis. The focal point of Part II is Mexico. It is very clear that since the beginning of the decade, Mexico has made major efforts to transform its economy in order to play a more significant role in the global economy. Different attempts have been undertaken leading to: first, address the aftermath of the debt crisis of 1982; second, modernize and open the economy through a structural change that have included, among other programs, privatization, deregulation, fiscal deficit reduction, and trade liberalization: and third, change the political landscape. Ephraim Clark models, in his “Agency Conflict and the Signaling Snafu in the Mexican Peso Crisis of 1994,” the conflict as a government held option to default and introduce signaling by assuming that the Mexican government had monopolistic information on the economy's true situation. The author argues that “if steps had been taken in late 1993 and early 1994, the crisis element of the adjustment could probably have been avoided.” Blaine's article examines the role of foreign capital in economic development. By studying the Mexican case, the author answers a number ofvery important questions: How are once protected markets going to react to a large inflow of foreign capital? How did Mexican authorities deal with these inflows? What are some of the lessons that could be derived from the Mexican experience? Hazera's paper discusses the history and legal basis of Mexican financial groups. On the basis of various stock market and financial statement data, an examination is also made of the groups’ evolution from 1991 to 1994. Eugene M. Salorio and Thomas L. Brewer consider, in “Expanding the Levels of Analysis of FDI for Improved Understanding of Policy issues: The Case of Mexico,” both macro-, and micro-level shifts of analysis which mutually complement one another, and yield, for example, a “components profile” of disaggregated national level FDI flows which depends on the type of the project. The authors identify far reaching implications for public policy that may be extrapolated from the case of Mexico to the new business environment faced by the Latin American countries. Francis A. Lees suggests also, from another angle, that the crisis of December 1994 could have been avoided because the financial disequilibrium was clearly evident by mid-1994 just be looking at Mexico's GDP and balance of payments.

102458,1990,inquiry,urban-rural differences in medicare physician expenditures,urban rural differences in medicare physician expenditures,"Policymakers have long been concerned with urban-rural disparities in access to health care. These disparities may be particularly severe in the case of the elderly and others covered by Medicare. Descriptive tables show that the total volume of physician services provided to rural beneficiaries is more than 40% lower than the volume of physician services provided to urban beneficiaries. This result is fairly consistent across all types of care and sites of care. In our econometric analysis, we investigate the factors that may explain these differences in utilization. The results indicate that, with prices held constant, variations in demographic and economic characteristics are not the major reasons for the urban-rural gap. Differences in hospital and physician (particularly specialist) availability appear to be the main factors. Collapse"

102460,1990,inquiry,the lifetime cost of injury,the lifetime cost of injury,"The evolution of fatal fighting was investigated using evolutionary game theory. General considerations about the lifetime consequences of fighting behaviour are first discussed. A sequential assessment game is then developed in which a fight can end because a contestant either gives up or is killed. The results show that the balance between the value of the contested resource and the value of the future is one important factor influencing the frequency of death or severe injury in fights. When the value of a contested resource is similar to or greater than the value of the future, strategies will evolve that result in contestants being severely injured or killed during fights. When the value of the future is close to zero contestants will never give up after starting to fight; such fights will always be fatal for at least one of the opponents. Factors that could decrease the cost of fighting, such as the assessment of fighting ability, kinship and role asymmetries, have little or no effect in these situations. Finally, empirical data on fatal fighting are reviewed and compared with theoretical predictions. Data show that dangerous fighting, often resulting in severe injuries or death, generally occurs in situations where a major part of a contestant's lifetime reproductive success is at stake. Empirical data on fighting behaviour clearly show that the cost of fighting varies greatly between species. In most species the frequency of severe injury is small or even zero. However, in some, really dangerous fighting does occur in which a significant proportion of the fights end with one or both of the contestants being severely injured or killed (for references, see Discussion), How can this variation between species be explained? Recent theoretical studies of fighting behaviour have focused on non-dangerous fighting (e.g. Maynard Smith & Price 1973; Maynard Smith 1982) and today we know of several mechanisms that give rise to evolutionarily stable strategies that effectively limit the use of dangerous behaviour patterns during fights. One such mechanism is the assessment of fighting ability, which allows the weaker individual to give up before being injured. In contrast, less attention has been directed towards explaining cases of fatal fighting (but see Hamilton 1979; Treisman & Collins 1980; Thornhilt & Alcock 1983; Grafen 1987). One possible reason for fatal fighting is that species differ in their ability to inflict injuries such that fatal fights occur only between animals equipped with efficient weapons. However, the fact that many well-armed species do not fight to the bitter end suggests that a more strategic explanation must apply. This is further supported by the fact that fatal fights tend to occur only when the value of victory is high. Our aim in this paper is to investigate the 0003-3472/90/010001+09 $03.00/0 evolution of fatal fighting using evolutionary game theory. First, we investigate under what circumstances fatal fights may evolve, and second, theoretical examples (evolutionary stable strategies, ESSs) of such fights are studied using the sequential assessment game (Enquist & Leimar 1983, 1987; Leimar & Enquist 1984). WHEN WILL FATAL FIGHTING EVOLVE? To answer this question it is necessary to investigate the lifetime consequences of fighting behaviour. Let us study a simple model. Consider an individual in a particular population (with some specified distribution of strategies). Let its expected lifetime utility be V+ V0 if it is in the possession of a resource, and/I0 if it is not. We interpret V as the value of the resource and V0 as the value of the future. When facing a conflict over a resource, an individual using a strategy S has an expected lifetime utility Ut given by U,(S)=p(S)V+[1 -q(S)]Vo (1) where p(S) is the probability of victory, and q(S) is a factor controlling how the value of the future (II0) changes due to fighting. Incidences of injury or expenditures of energy and time make q positive for cases of biological interest (for instance, q could be the probability of fatal injury), The situation is sometimes more complex than described by this 9 1990 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Collapse"

Results indicate that UR is associated with larger reductions in utilization and expenditures in markets with low HMO enrollment, high admissions per capita, and low hospital occupancy rates. These results suggest that health care market conditions that permit unnecessary use are the ones under which UR programs can be most effective. Collapse"

Between 1969 and fiscal year 1987-88, the overall separation rate decreased by 16%, accompanied by a 23% decrease in average length of stay. For the elderly, the separation rate increased by 14% and three quarter of this increase was for surgical procedures, mostly new high-technology procedures. For the nonelderly, separation rates decreased by 25%. Lengths of stay decreased in both age groups. Over the last two decades overall separation rates in British Columbia were higher than or equal to separation rates in the United States, and lengths of stay were consistently higher in British Columbia. Since access to hospitals by the elderly is similar in the two countries, lower hospital costs in Canada result from factors other than lower overall hospital utilization or decreased access for the elderly.

A two-tiered system was developed for ambulatory chart review based on 15 hospitalization diagnoses having a potential for inadequate prehospital care. This system was applied to 796 cases from the HMOs (2% of admissions). Technical problems limited actual review to 673 of these cases. Although 304 (45%) of reviewed cases failed initial screening, physician review found only 22% of such failures (10% of reviewed cases) to represent probable quality of care problems. The approach appears to be feasible and unusually efficient. Although there is considerable variability that limits its potential use for interhealth plan comparison, the approach holds promise for quality assurance within an individual health plan. Collapse"

Multiple choice of health plans is not containing costs of health care or insurance premiums because employers have not yet tried price competition with cost-conscious consumer choice. HMOs in multiple choice arrangements have not saved employers money because of the way employers manage competition. Effective management of competition must be an active process employing an array of tools to create incentives that reward production of high quality economical care. Collapse"

102495,1990,international journal of forecasting,the role of judgment in macroeconomic forecasting accuracy,the role of judgment in macroeconomic forecasting accuracy,"Abstract This paper presents evidence on the role that judgmental adjustments play in macroeconomic forecast accuracy. It starts by contrasting the predictive records of four prominent forecasters who adjust their models with those of three models that are used mechanically. The adjusted forecasts tend to be more accurate overall, although important exceptions can be found. Next the article compares adjusted forecasts with those generated mechanically by the same model. Again, with some significant exceptions, judgmental adjustments improve accuracy more often than not. The article closes by considering whether macroeconomic forecasters should place more or less emphasis on their adjustments relative to their models. It finds a clear tendency for modelers to overadjust their models, illustrating what prominent psychologists have termed “the major error of intuitive prediction”. In short, model builders should not hesitate to adjust their models to offset their limitations but should also guard against the tendency to overestimate the value of their personal insights.

Our large data set, comprising over 7,000 pairs of forecasts and outcomes, includes one-, two-, and three-step ahead semi-annual forecasts of the main components of demand, output and prices for Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S.A. over the twenty-year period 1968–1987. Various measures of accuracy are computed; also a comparison is made with competing naive and time-series predictions. The analysis includes a full range of diagnostic checks on forecast performance, including rationality tests for unbiasedness, efficiency and consistency. Although there is considerable variation in the accuracy of these forecasts, they are generally superior to the naive and time-series predictions. Error is predominantly non-systematic. However, our analysis exposes exceptions, particularly forecasts of government consumption, and in some of the forecasts of fixed and inventory investment, the foreign balance and inflation. Accuracy in these cases could be improved by a simple linear correction, or by incorporating information contained in recent, known forecast errors. At least half the OECD forecasts fail one or more of the rationality tests. Collapse"

Such contracts might appear inherently undesirable because they seem to compromise auditors' independence. Nevertheless, auditors in the United Kingdom are permitted implicitly to accept such contracts, because they can take an ownership interest in the firms they audit. In 1988, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) attempted to pressure the AICPA into allowing contingent fee contracts for all services (including audits), although the FTC subsequently compromised by insisting on allowing contingent fees only for nonaudit work.1 This controversy surrounding the desirability of contingent audit fees motivates our study.

Third, are the effects of structure on audit effectiveness and efficiency constant across increasing time pressure? While psychology research relates to the independent performance effects of time pressure and program structure, both pressure and structure are imposed, for legal and economic reasons, in the audit environment (Cushing and Loebbecke [1986]). Therefore, this research attempts to determine whether and how the joint imposition of program structure and time constraints affects auditors' performance. One hundred seventy-nine staff auditors from a national public accounting firm participated in an experiment that involved implementing a partial year-end audit program testing details of inventory, a task which is an analogue of those normally performed by auditors under time pressure. Four levels of time pressure and two types of audit programs (structured and unstructured) were manipulated between subjects. Re- Collapse"

This study adds to the empirical literature on forecasting financial distress by showing conditions under which debt default may be a rational economic decision by the firm's shareholders. This analysis departs from empirical financial distress studies which are often not linked to an underlying economic theory. The focus on covenant default also extends the literature which has modeled bankruptcy (Bulow and Shoven [1978]) and liquidation decisions (Titman [1984]) but which has not considered a common first symptom of financial distress-covenant default. Briefly, the model examines the costs that influence shareholders' decision to comply with or violate a particular debt covenant: payment of a current obligation. These costs include those associated with bondholders' reaction to possible default. The model predicts that shareholders will default when, holding other factors constant, (i) interest rates have declined relative to coupon rates stated in the debt issue; (ii) the probability of paying future obligations is high; and (iii) the cost of obtaining funds to pay the obligation is high. The model also predicts when stockholders and bondholders will renegotiate the debt contract and the amount of wealth transferred in the renegotiation. Finally, the Collapse"

Failure to integrate is defined here as failure to make mental connections between separately received pieces of information; reconstruction is defined here as altering the mental representation of information to make it consistent with existing knowledge (or memories). I asked auditors to review model work papers containing contradictions they would have discovered in the absence of reconstruction or failure to integrate. Subjects were able to refer freely to the experimental materials during their reviews, as they could do on actual audit engagements during the work paper review process. Since the work papers related to several audit tests and took about one hour to review, subjects had to use their memories to relate critical observations made earlier to later pieces of evidence when attempting to formulate an accurate representation of the meaning of all the evidence taken together, including detection of the contradictions. I found that subjects at all levels of experience made memory errors, and that both types of memory error were related to experience. Inex- Collapse"

Estimates of annual AIDS incidence were calculated by adjusting the surveillance data for reporting delays, unreported HIV risks, and the 1993 change in the AIDS case definition. Between 1990 and 1995, estimated AIDS incidence in young MSM declined 29%, from 1400 to 1000 cases; however, trends in incidence varied greatly by race/ethnicity. Annual AIDS incidence decreased 50% in whites during this period (from 720 to 360), but fell just 2% in blacks (from 430 to 420) and rose 5% in Hispanics (from 220 to 230). Trends in incidence also differed by metropolitan statistical area (MSA) size. Between 1990 and 1995, AIDS incidence declined 37% in MSAs with populations of 2,500,000 people or more and 28% in MSAs with 1,000,000 to 2,499,999 people, but incidence decreased only 15% in MSAs with 500,000 to 999,999 people, and 13% in MSAs with 50,000 to 499,999. Incidence in nonmetropolitan (i.e., rural) areas was unchanged. Young black and Hispanic MSM now account for most young MSM with AIDS, and incidence in young MSM in small MSAs and rural areas has been relatively constant. Trends in AIDS incidence indicate that levels of HIV infection have remained persistently high in certain populations of young MSM, underscoring the immense need for HIV prevention programs targeted specifically toward these young men.

This article studies the relationship between stated intentions and subsequent behavior under the “best-case” hypothesis that individuals have rational expectations and that their responses to intentions questions are best predictions of their future behavior. The objective is to place an upper bound on the behavioral information contained in intentions data and to determine whether prevailing approaches to the analysis of intentions data respect the bound. The analysis focuses on the simplest form of intentions questions, those that call for yes/no predictions of binary outcomes. The article also discusses “forced-choice” questions, which are distinct from, but are sometimes confused with, intentions questions. A primary lesson is that not too much should be expected of intentions data. It is shown that intentions data bound but do not identify the probability that a person will behav... Collapse"

For example, soils may become toxic to native tree species because of soil acidification. Ecological effects models being built to study these potential problems have a need for regional deposition estimates with associated measures of uncertainty. However, statistical estimation of the deposition process is complicated by a strong spatial trend (mean nonstationarity) and apparently a spatial covariance structure dependent on location (covariance nonstationarity). The available data for calculating deposition estimates consist of several hundred point observations at irregularly spaced sampling locations across the United States. The spatial estimation technique of kriging is the foundation of four deposition estimation methods evaluated in this study. These are lognormal kriging with a single model of the spatial covariance structure (the variogram); single-... Collapse"
102610,1990,journal of the american statistical association,the adjoint projection pursuit regression,the adjoint projection pursuit regression,"Abstract Consider a projection pursuit regression model y = g(α + β x) + e, with an arbitrary monotonic link function g. We assume the link function is unknown; thus we can only estimate the direction of β, that is, the ratios among the components of β, say, β 1/β 2. The direction of β is a useful estimand that measures, say, how many units of x 2 is equivalent to one unit of x 1 in terms of potency in affecting the outcome y. Projection pursuit regression usually solves the equation cov(x, y − E(y | β x)) = 0. As an alternative, we propose to solve the adjoint equation cov(x − E(x | β x), y) = 0. The adjoint equation has the advantage that E(x | β x) might be easier to estimate than E(y | β x). We establish two main results for the population case. First, β is the unique solution (up to a multiplicative scalar) to the adjoint equation. Second, β satisfies a fixed-point property based on a modified least squares regression derived from the adjoint equation. We apply the population results to two important... Collapse"

The test enjoys power properties akin to those in a parametric setting, in the sense that it can distinguish between regression functions distant only n −1/2 apart, where n is the sample size. It has exceptional level accuracy, with level error of only n −2, and uses a very accurate estimate of the critical point of an exact test, being in error by only n −3/2 under the null hypothesis. The test admits several generalizations, for example to the case of testing for differences between several regression means. (This is a nonparametric regression analog of analysis of variance.) A simulation study using n as small as 15 corroborates the asymptotic result on level accuracy of the bootstrap test. Applications are illustrated with an example involving acid rain data. Collapse"
102612,1990,journal of the american statistical association,adaptive cluster sampling,adaptive cluster sampling,"Abstract In many real-world sampling situations, researchers would like to be able to adaptively increase sampling effort in the vicinity of observed values that are high or otherwise interesting. This article describes sampling designs in which, whenever an observed value of a selected unit satisfies a condition of interest, additional units are added to the sample from the neighborhood of that unit. If any of these additional units satisfies the condition, still more units may be added. Sampling designs such as these, in which the selection procedure is allowed to depend on observed values of the variable of interest, are in contrast to conventional designs, in which the entire selection of units to be included in the sample may be determined prior to making any observations. Because the adaptive selection procedure introduces biases into conventional estimators, several estimators are given that are design unbiased for the population mean with the adaptive cluster designs of this article; that is, the ...

102614,1990,journal of the american statistical association,inference for near-integrated time series with infinite variance,inference for near integrated time series with infinite variance,"Abstract An autoregressive time series is said to be near-integrated (nearly nonstationary) if some of its characteristic roots are close to the unit circle. Statistical inference for the least squares estimators of near-integrated AR(1) models has been under rigorous study recently both in the statistics and econometric literatures. Although classical asymptotics are no longer available, through the study of weak convergence of stochastic processes, one can establish the asymptotic theories in terms of simple diffusion processes or Brownian motions. Such results rely heavily on the finiteness of the variance of the noise. When this finite variance condition fails, whereas many physical and economic phenomena are believed to be generated by an infinite variance noise sequence, the aforementioned asymptotics are not applicable. In this article, a unified theory concerning near-integrated autoregressive time series with infinite variance is developed. In particular, when the noise sequence {e t } belongs to... Collapse"
102615,1990,journal of the american statistical association,bias of autoregressive spectral estimators,bias of autoregressive spectral estimators,"Abstract Bias of the least squares estimator of the log of the spectral density of an autoregression attenuates the peaks of the estimator. Under the assumption of an autoregressive generating process of known finite order, we obtain an expression for the order 1/T bias, where T is the sample length of the observed series. This approximation is a sum of several simple functions of the unknown coefficients. When the spectral density has sharp peaks, one of these functions dominates the bias. The attenuation from this dominant component can be substantial when the spectral peak is well defined, and several examples illustrate this effect. Since the integral of the order 1/T bias components that are frequency dependent is 0, unbiased estimation of entropy to this order is possible for autoregressive processes. These bias expressions extend to autoregressive models in which the mean is a polynomial function of time. Similar results obtain for the log of the Yule-Walker spectral estimator, for which the order ... Collapse"
102616,1990,journal of the american statistical association,on bootstrap iteration for coverage correction in confidence intervals,on bootstrap iteration for coverage correction in confidence intervals,"Abstract Iterated bootstrap procedures may be used to reduce error in many statistical problems. We discuss their use in constructing confidence intervals with accurate coverage and show that bootstrap coverage correction produces improvements in coverage accuracy of order n −1/2 in one-sided intervals, but of order n −1 in two-sided intervals. Explicit formulas are provided for the dominant term in coverage error after iteration in each case. These results are used to compare various iterated bootstrap intervals and to assess the effect of bootstrap iteration on other indicators of interval performance, such as position of critical points and length of interval. We show that, for one-sided intervals, the coverage-correction algorithm yields critical points that are second-order correct. This is not the case for two-sided intervals, where second-order correctness is not crucial in obtaining high-order coverage accuracy. We also show that the asymptotic mean increase in length between the original and cove... Collapse"
102618,1990,journal of the american statistical association,estimation following a sequentially designed experiment,estimation following a sequentially designed experiment,"Abstract We investigate the design of experiments for the nonparametric estimation of the root of an unknown regression function. Approaches to this problem include the Robbins-Monro (1951), Venter (1967), and Lai-Robbins (1979, 1981) stochastic approximation procedures and Wu's (1985, 1986) sequential maximum likelihood estimators. Because the regression function is not assumed to belong to a parametric family, only experimentation near to the root is informative and the sequential design should converge to the root. After the sequential design has been generated, there are at least two distinct methods for estimation of the root: (a) estimate the root by the last design point, or (b) fit a parametric model. Except for Ruppert (1988) and simulation studies by Bodt (1985) and Bodt and Tingey (1990), all studies known to us of stochastic approximation procedures used the last design point as the estimator. Wu (1985, 1986) fit a generalized linear model. When the last design point is the estimator, then cle... Collapse"
102722,1990,journal of consumer research,reinterpretation of mere exposure or exposure of mere reinterpretation?,reinterpretation of mere exposure or exposure of mere reinterpretation,"n his article entitled ""The Logic of Mere Exposure: A Reinterpretation . . . ,"" Timothy B. Heath (1990) provides a useful tutorial on the difference between moderation and mediation (Baron and Kenny 1986; Brown 1989). Heath illustrates this distinction as it pertains to the research on mere exposure effects via the reinterpretation of a study reported by Anand, Holbrook, and Stephens (1988). By means of this discussion, he claims to show that Anand et al.'s empirical work ""unwittingly supported"" a conclusion that runs ""contrary"" to that intended. Specifically, he argues that the study by Anand et al. is ""more consistent"" with an independence hypothesis (in which affect may occur without cognition) than with a cognitive-affective model (in which affect depends on some kind of cognitive mediation). When Anand et al. (1988, p. 386) say that they ""seek evidence for cognitive mediation in the formation of affect,"" Heath assumes that such ""cognitive mediation"" must involve a process wherein objective familiarity (OF) -* cognition or subjective familiarity (SF) -* affect (as shown, e.g., in his Table 1). Thus, drawing on his Figure 1, Heath represents Anand et al. as concluding ""that OF causes cognition (SF), which in turn causes affect"" (1990, p. 242, repeated verbatim on p. 243) and proceeds to point out that ""this reasoning . . . suffers from two distinct shortcomings"" (p. 242). The second of these ""shortcomings"" hinges on a claim that the authors ""confuse tests of moderation (OF by SF interaction) with those of mediation (OF -* SF -* evaluation)"" (p. 243). We share this concern for the difference between mediation and moderation, and we acknowledge that Heath has identified an unfortunate looseness in our use of the term ""cognitive mediation."" However, though Heath's critique does distinguish correctly between moderation (as in ANOVA) and mediation (as in path analysis), it fails to note that Anand et al. used the term ""cognitive mediation"" in a more general sense to refer to processes of cognition that underlie the formation of affect. We now regret this somewhat casual use of the term ""mediation."" However, we did not anticipate that readers might construe our ANOVA approach from the viewpoint of path analysis. The reason we failed to anticipate this possibility is that it makes no sense to suggest that a straightforward ANOVA such as ours, in which some dependent variable (C) is affected by two factors (A and B) and their interaction (A X B), can permit any sort of meaningful interpretation as a path analysis in which A --BC or A -A X BC. For this reason, it never occurred to us to try to interpret our results via a path-analytic framework. Yet Heath represents our analysis as concluding that OF -* SF -* affect. In actuality, we never intended any such thing. Rather, we clearly indicated that ""the objective familiarity effect was moderated [i.e., qualified] by a significant objective X subjective familiarity interaction"" (1988, p. 389). Our explicit use of the term ""moderated"" (meaning ""qualified"") should have discouraged any critique based on ""mediation"" in the path-analytic sense. Indeed, we never claimed a path-analytic OF-SF-affect mediation of the type that Heath describes (and could not have done so without committing gross errors in logic). If one were to insist on adopting a path-analytic view of our study (a perspective that we definitely do not recommend), one would need to construct a model of the following form: Collapse"

Since resources are often controlled through indigenous systems of property, the tragedy of the commons has been used to explain resource degradation. As a result, private property is suggested as a solution to resource degradation. A dynamic model capable of examining household incentives for resource use under private and common property is developed. Results of the model reject the conventional wisdom that gives rise to the presumed optimality of private (individual) property in natural resources, and the correlated indictment of group management regimes.

Long-run potentials (ceiling), diffusion rates, and the effects of other economic variables on the adoption path are determined simultaneously within the model. Results from our final model indicate that the diffusion rate is not constant over time. Furthermore, rate and level of adoption are found to be influenced by flood damage, jute-rice price ratio and HYRV—local rice variety price ratio. An important outcome of our analysis is that the ceiling adoption level for Bangladesh has nearly been reached. Unless new HYRVs are developed with wider adaptability, especially for drought and flood prone areas, little scope exists for production increases through HYRV acreage expansion. This conclusion has significant policy implications for agricultural planners and development agents in Bangladesh. Collapse"

A three-sector, two-commodity general equilibrium model is specified and migration takes place from backward agriculture to a modern agricultural and a modern manufacturing sector. The consequences on urban unemployment, welfare, size of the backward sector etc. of general and selective labor and capital subsidies and a migration tax are clarified. A labor subsidy does not, under any factor intensity assumptions, have an unambiguously decreasing effect on unemployment. A tax on the urban labor force lowers unemployment and raises welfare.

We find that less than half of the 11 percent annual increase in overall manufacturing labor productivity can be attributed to capital deepening, and that the importance of this factor and total factor productivity advance varied sharply across industries. Heavy industries accumulated capital per worker at a faster pace, and realized total factor productivity growth at a much slower rate, than others did. This contrast may be related to the extensive capital subsidies provided to the former as part of an import-substitution program. Also, the rapid total factor productivity growth in labor-intensive manufacturing industries was accompanied by rapid growth in average firm size, supporting the argument that the shift from craft to modern production techniques has been a major source of productivity growth.

This study examines the impact of agricultural policy on reducing the gap and ways to achieve food security in Iraq for the period 1990-2015. The study of both red meat and poultry meat was considered as a major part of the community's food security. Two models were used in the analysis: the production policy model and the food gap model. In the production policy analysis, production was used as a dependent factor, consumption, And the coefficient of protection as independent factors. As for the food gap model, it was used as a dependent factor, production, local price for previous year, world price for previous year and consumption as independent factors.

The choice is between schemes which aim for wide coverage at potentially low wages and schemes which ration participation so that more beneficiaries can escape poverty. Conditions are derived for ranking stylized policy alternatives in terms of a broad class of poverty measures. The preferred policy is shown to depend on the budget level, administrative cost, the initial wage distribution, and the policy maker's aversion to poverty. Empirical simulations for Bangladesh data generally support wide coverage for distributionally sensitivity poverty measures but limited coverage for other measures. Collapse"

For this sample of children, health benefits from unsupplemented breastfeeding differ by mother's education, with children of less educated mothers deriving the most gains.

An overlapping generations general equilibrium model is employed aggregating household decisions about fertility, savings, and investment in the human capital of children with the objective of studying intertemporal relationships among population growth, income distribution, inter-generation social mobility, skill composition of the labor force, and household income. As a result of endogenous fertility, the equilibrium path attains steady state from the second generation. Income tax transfer, child taxation, and social security taxation policies are also examined in the paper. A structural explanation is given for the inverse household income-child quantity and negative child quality-quantity relationships seen in developing countries. In a Cobb-Douglas economy, these relationships hold in the short-run, potentially working over the long-run in other economies. Overall, the model shows that group interests may hinder emergence of perfect capital markets with private initiatives. Where developing countries are concerned, these results have strong implications for population policy. A policy mix of building good quality schools, or subsidizing rural education, introducing a formal social security program, and providing high-yield, risk-free investments, banking, and insurance services to the poor is recommended.

These differences are hypothesized to reflect rational, organizationally efficient private and public decisions in the face of divergent economic conditions at the outset of export-led growth, and associated higher costs of market transactions in Korea than Taiwan. The transactions costs hypothesis is shown to have superior explanatory power to the hypotheses that differences in product mix and in policy account for firm size differences. Collapse"

Supply is estimatd by linear programming representative farm models incorporating private and official market incentives, and official procurement and input rations. Demand is represented by a modified linear expenditure system incorporating rationed official supplies. A linear complementarity problem calculates the private market equilibrium subject to official market outcomes and institutional constraints. Results from a case study of Burkina Faso show that reforms improve agricultural performance, but depend on cotton exports to pay for fertilizer. Relaxing institutional constraints, such as foreign exchange allocations for fertilizer imports and capacity of official marketing systems, will be crucial for meeting reform objectives. Collapse"

Quotas affect the responsiveness of imports to real exchange rates, tariffs and activity levels, and the combined effects of quotas and other variables are hard to gauge when data are only available for the constrained regime. In this paper, we show that theoretical results cannot unambiguously sign the effect of quotas on import responsiveness. We also estimate on Moroccan data import demand equations that take explicit account of the presence of quotas. The results suggest that quantity restrictions had a significant impact not only on the level of imports, but on their sensitivity to income and price variations as well. By estimating the demand for foreign goods under rationing we are also able to predict the behavior of imports in response to the elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. Collapse"

The focus is on the role played by specialized, differentiated business services in manufacturing production and how foreign investment - through its ability to increase the extent of the market and induce greater specialization in producer services - enhances the productivity of nationally-owned industry and raises national welfare. The gains yielded by foreign capital inflows within this context are shown to operate whether the economy is at full-employment or under unemployment. In the latter case, it turns out to be critical that one consider not only the direct industrial employment created by foreign investment but also the induced secondary employment generated in the service sector.

The paper demonstrates that foreign capital inflows respond to government restrictions and the cost of foreign transactions. Previous research, based on single-equation models, has concluded that the amount of capital inflows is a positive indicator of LDC creditworthiness. By contrast, this paper estimates a simultaneous limited-dependent variable model, in order to capture the endogeneity of capital inflows. The estimate yields a reversal in sign for the coefficient of the capital inflows variable. The paper suggests that defensive lending may explain this finding. Collapse"
102777,1990,journal of econometrics,the role of multiplier bounds in efficiency analysis with application to kansas farming,the role of multiplier bounds in efficiency analysis with application to kansas farming,"Abstract As long recognized, the problem of efficiency involves both technical and economic facets. Determination of the technically efficient firms provides the base for economic analysis. Values in terms of prices or costs must be introduced into the problem to work towards finding firms which might be regarded as overall efficient. That problem came to the forefront in a 1984 study to find the best site for location of a Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) in the state of Texas. Application of a modern value-free frontier method called Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to the data, which was primarily engineering and geological in character, showed five of the six feasible sites were technically efficient. However, additional socioeconomic/environmental data provided ‘price-cost’ inequality bounds for the mathematical multipliers in the DEA problem. Including those bounds in the analysis, which was called an Assurance Region (AR), reduced the number of efficient sites from five to one. In 1988, the U.S. Department of Energy in national competitionactually selected the site identified by the bounding method for location of the SSC. In this paper, the AR concept is defined for efficiency analysis of the linear production possibility set. As applied here to 83 farms, we use only the special case of AR consisting of separate linear homogeneous restrictions on the input and output multipliers. When applied to the technically efficient farms, the AR principles reduced the number of candidates for overall efficiency from 23 to 8 in one case (Ratio Model) and from 44 to 13 in another case (Convex Model)."
102787,1990,journal of econometrics,testing nonnested euler conditions with quadrature-based methods of approximation,testing nonnested euler conditions with quadrature based methods of approximation,"Abstract Singleton (1985) proposed a test of the validity of an Euler equation specification which incorporates information on a nonnested set of Euler equations from an alternative economic model. The information about the alternative model is introduced into the testing framework by constructing a sequence of local alternatives to the Euler equations of the maintained model which are in the direction of the Euler equations of the alternative model. Singleton's test is easy to apply, but is designed to have power against an alternative that in many cases does not have a straightforward economic interpretation. In this paper, we reexamine the construction of local alternatives to Euler equations. We compare Singleton's approach with a method based on perturbing the data-generation process (DGP) of the maintained model in the direction of the DGP of the alternative model. The second approach leads to tests which are always of interest, but require the complete specification of the DGP. In this paper, we derive a test for discriminating between two nonnested sets of Euler conditions which have been estimated us ing Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The test is based on the Encompassing Principle of Cox (1961) and Mizon and Richard (1986), and uses Tauchen's (1986) quadrature-based nethods for approximating the expectation of nonlinear functions of stationary random variables.

Our results suggest that even well-read scholars are less knowledgeable about journals outside their fields. They know the top two or three journals in other fields and perceive them to be of good quality, but for journals below that they indicate that they have “no knowledge.” There are identifiable cohort groups in some cases that are more aware of each others' journals. There are also fields whose journals were less well known than others—business law, insurance, real estate, and, most notably, management information systems. We conclude that publishing faculty tend to be specialists. They have limited knowledge of journals outside their speciality. The promotion and tenure process, however, often assumes that faculty can evaluate the publication records of faculty from other specialties.

Although there has been quite a lot of theoretical discussion of this issue there is relatively little empirical evidence. Although hedged about by reservations we conclude that the principal factor that determines preferences are the‘job risk’ characteristics of the coop and the privately owned firm. To a very large extent a worker will prefer the coop to a private buy-out if it leads to increased job security and if the coop is considered to be viable. We also find that workers expected that everyone would work harder in the coop and that this, together with increased shop floor control of production, was expected to lead to higher earnings. Significantly, however, these expected differences in the work/earnings trade-off between the coop and the privately owned firm did not lead workers to prefer one to the other. Collapse"

All of six member societies will jointly contribute to the publication of JJSD. JSCS was established in 1986. I played the role of chief editor of JJSCS since then until 1990, and was responsible for the publication of volumes 1 to 3. The major purpose of establishing JSCS was to make a progress in computational statistics in Japan by providing a forum for people working in various aspects of computational statistics, e.g., statisticians engaged in the research and application of statistical theory and methods, computer scientists/engineers engaged in the development of statistical software, and statisticians/data analysts engaged in the analysis of data obtained with surveys, experiments or other means, and provide them opportunities for exchanging information and ideas and, if possible, for finding seeds for joint works among them. For producing better products as well as for getting more valuable outcomes using the products, it is vital to know what the counterpart really wishes between the producers and the users (or consumers) of everything including statistical methods and software. In those days our major interest was in the R & D of statistical program packages (SPP) as described in President Address (JSCS Japanese journal, Volume 1, Number 1) by the first president Chooichiro Asano. I myself was interested in R & D of SPP on personal computers with my colleagues, that is useful both for the data analysis and for the research work of statistical methods. There are three remarkable traditions in JSCS. I like these traditions and think that they have contributed very much to the achievement of the purpose of establishment mentioned above. One is social gathering at the time of scientific meeting. Every time it is organized in such a way that participants can talk freely in a comfortable atmosphere for exchanging information and ideas. The second one is the tradition that president of JSCS is elected alternately from academic and non-academic communities so that both sides will be satisfied equally in a long period. The third one is that it is very positive in international activities, for example, Japan and Korea Conferences, Japan and China Symposia, and also organizing international meetings such as 25 JSCS Symposium in Busan in 2011, two international scientific meetings for 30 Anniversary in Okinawa and Seattle in 2015 and 2016. Since around a decade ago the environment of statistics has been changing due to advances in the computer and information technology, and accordingly it has strong effect on statistical science especially computational statistics. Let us briefly review what happened. Collapse"
102809,1990,journal of economic behavior and organization,producer's dilemma experiments:  reply,producers dilemma experiments reply,"When a shoal of small fish is at risk of being attacked by a pike, an individual or a small group of fish may leave the safety of the shoal and approach the predator to inspect it to obtain information about the pending risk (Magurran et al. 1985; Pitcher 1992). A pair of fish that jointly carries out a predator inspection visit is probably in a Prisoner’s Dilemma (Milinski 1987, 1990, 1992). Both fish share the risk of being eaten. As one fish proceeds, however, it must rely on the other one’s following, although this other fish may be tempted to rush back and watch the leading fish’s fate from a safe distance. Assuming a Prisoner’s Dilemma, I have interpreted my experimental results with sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus (Milinski 1987), as evidence for a Titfor-Tat-like cooperation strategy that is based on reciprocity (Axelrod & Hamilton 1981; Nowak & Sigmund 1992). This interpretation was corroborated by further experiments and observations both with sticklebacks (Milinski et al. 1990a, b; Külling & Milinski 1992; Huntingford et al. 1994) and guppies, Poecilia reticulata (Dugatkin 1988, 1991; Dugatkin & Alfieri 1991a, b). A challenging alternative interpretation has been proposed by Connor (1996): ‘a model of by-product mutualism that includes partner preferences can account for all those phenomena during predator inspection in fish that have previously been attributed to a cooperative strategy, Tit for Tat, based on the Prisoner’s Dilemma’ (page 451). West-Eberhard (1975) defined byproduct mutualism as mutualism that is maintained by ordinary selfish behaviour incidentally benefiting neighbours. Individuals may increase the by-product benefits they receive by coordinating their actions (Connor 1996), for example, by jointly inspecting a predator. How can we test which hypothesis better explains the results? Theoretically, this is easily done because the two hypotheses are mutually exclusive. By-product mutualism is not feasible if the inspecting fish are in a Prisoner’s Dilemma, whereas Tit-for-Tat reciprocity does not make sense outside a Prisoner’s Dilemma. Connor (1996) is right when he says that unequivocal evidence has not been provided for the Prisoner’s Dilemma in this situation. I have always argued that a Prisoner’s Dilemma is possible in predator inspection and that there is some evidence for it (Milinski 1987, 1990, 1992), such as the two following facts. (1) Usually small groups or single fish inspect the predator (e.g. Magurran 1990; Pitcher 1992), although joining an inspector or a group should become increasingly attractive with each additional inspector because of the risk dilution (‘safety in numbers’) and the confusion effect. This observation seems to fit the Prisoner’s Dilemma paradigm, because Tit-for-Tat cooperation in an iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma is only stable in small groups, especially in pairs (Boyd & Richerson 1988). (2) In a Prisoner’s Dilemma, the highest payoff is gained by an individual that defects when the partner cooperates. Does a fish that avoids the risk and stays behind obtain enough information to have a higher net benefit (i.e. the fitness increase from information gained minus the fitness reduction from potential risk) than the fish that proceeds on its own? Supporting evidence is provided by experimental studies with minnows, Phoxinus phoxinus (Pitcher et al. 1986; Magurran & Higham 1988). Thus, it seems more likely than not that the Prisoner’s Dilemma is fulfilled. It is a Correspondence: M.

102813,1990,journal of economic behavior and organization,"an economic, organizational and behavioral model of the determinants of ceo tenure",an economic organizational and behavioral model of the determinants of ceo tenure,"Abstract This paper seeks to determine the extent to which chief executive officer (CEO) reward systems align the interests of CEOs with interests of stockholders and, therefore, counter the agency problem. The theoretical framework used differs from previous research in two major areas. First, the model focuses on the determinants of CEO tenure rather than CEO compensation, an explicit acknowledgement that most firms do not rely solely on firm performance to determine executive compensation, but rather depend on the ‘going rate’ for CEOs. Second, the model integrates the theoretical constructs from economic, organizational, and behavioral theory. This interdisciplinary model should provide a broader perspective of the environment in which CEOs operate and minimize the pitfalls associated with prior research which has generally adopted the perspective of only a single discipline. The empirical results from this study show that the power structure of an organization and certain key behavioral traits of CEOs are important in the CEO reward system, independent of firm performance. Moreover, these factors even seem to supercede the influence of corporate performance in their impact on CEO tenure. Collapse"

(1990). “Patent statistics as economic indicators: A survey”. Journal of Economic Literature 28, 1661–1707]. The first notable development is the availability of patent data on an increasingly global scale and the accompanying global spread of research using patent data. The availability of global patent data has increased the value of patent information in a number of ways. The second notable development is the significant expansion of research using citation information as well as better understanding of its nature. Citation information has been found to provide very useful information on the value of patents, although backward citation as a measure of information flow is found to be more controversial. The third major development is the extensive implementation of surveys such as the “innovation survey” of firms and the inventor survey. They have deepened our understanding of the usefulness and the constraints of bibliographic indicators based on patent. The forth development is better understanding of the nature of the patent system and the reformulation of patent data, a good example of which is the development of patent family data, based on priority information.

102854,1990,journal of economic perspectives,the labor market status of black americans:  1939-1985,the labor market status of black americans   1939 1985,"A fter substantial economic gains near the time of World War I, black Americans experienced little progress during the interwar period, 1918-1939. When Gunnar Myrdal (1944) made his famous argument that the contradiction between Americans' espoused commitment to equal opportunity and whites' actual discrimination against blacks would pose an ""American Dilemnma"" for the coming era of democracy, serious students of race relations seldom disagreed about the dismal economic position of black Americans. But since Myrdal's prediction, there have been great changes in race relations and in blacks' economic status. In this paper, I document some of these changes and I discuss some arguments that have been offered as explanations of the changes in blacks' economic status. Among the empirical changes since 1939, three stand out: 1) three decades of rapid progress followed by two decades of relative stagnation in many aggregate measures of relative black earnings and incomes; 2) declining employment of black males; and 3) heightened inequality within the black population. Students of the economics of race relations must address a fundamental question: Why has relative black employment fallen when blacks' wages and their access to occupations and to institutions of higher education have improved so much? This question leads to a consideration of the extent to which these changes may be interpreted as changes in discrimination and its consequences; changes and differences in skills; and changes in the relative wages of workers of different skills.

102855,1990,journal of economic perspectives,the role of human capital in earnings differences between black and white men,the role of human capital in earnings differences between black and white men,"D uring the past 50 years, the earnings of black men have increased substantially both in absolute terms and relative to those of white men, as shown in Figure 1. In 1940 the black-white weekly earnings ratio among men ages 25-34 was 49 percent; by 1980 it had increased to 79 percent. During the 1980s, however, the overall black-white earnings gap did not narrow, and at younger ages the gap actually widened. Although the 1980s is not the first decade since 1940 in which black men made little or no gains in relative earnings-the 1950s was another-the lack of progress in the 1980s is nevertheless puzzling and a source of concern. This article examines the factors underlying the differential in earnings between black men and white men, with a focus on the role of human capital. Since 1940, successive generations of black men entering the labor force have been increasingly more educated relative to white men, both in terms of years of school completed and in the quality of schooling obtained. As the education and income levels of black parents increased, racial differences in the transmission of human capital in the home were also likely to have narrowed. This convergence in educational differences combined with the migration of blacks out of the South contributed to the narrowing in the racial gap in earnings over the 1940-80 period, particularly in the first half of the period. But human capital factors-education and migration-were not the only source of convergence in black-white differences in earnings. The patterns of change in the earnings gap support the contention that declining labor market discrimination against blacks has also contributed to the rise in the black-white earnings ratio. Moreover, the acquisition of human capital itself has been strongly affected by societal and governmental discrimination, since blacks were long provided with greatly inferior schooling resources.

The Supreme Court decisions in the summer of 1989 nailed down the coffin lid.' But affirmative action has carried more symbolic than real weight, and symbols have ways of persisting even when the body of law and regulation lies six feet under. The tenth anniversary of its passing is an appropriate time to consider what it achieved during its conflicted existence, and whether its possible resurrection is to be feared or welcomed. Affirmative action is one of the most controversial government interventions in the labor market since the abolition of slavery. In recent years, two major criticisms of affirmative action have found prominent voice. The first is that affirmative action does not work; therefore, we should dispose of it. The second is that affirmative action does work; therefore, we should dispose of it. My chief concern in this paper will be with the first of these criticisms. Was affirmative action successful in increasing employment opportunities for blacks? In this paper, affirmative action will refer to the provisions of Lyndon Johnson's Executive Order 11246 in 1965, as amended by Richard Nixon's Executive Order 11375 [3 C.F.R. 169 (1974)]. This focus is distinct from affirmative action required as a remedy by judicial decision, which is not the primary focus here. Collapse"

In 1960, 33 percent of black children were not living with two parents. By 1988, the figure had risen to 61 percent. During the same period, the fraction of all black children born to an unmarried mother rose from 23 percent to over 60 percent. This paper examines the patterns of family change, briefly discusses their economic implications, and explores what is known about the economic reasons for those changes. Unfortunately, there remains no clear indication of why families changed so much, in part because of the modest amount of work in this field. But the data do reveal some important hints, and our hope is that this paper may serve to inspire more and better research. Collapse"

Within minutes to hours after extrication of survivors trapped under fallen masonry (and immediately following decompression of limbs), a massive volume of extracellular fluid is lost into the injured muscles, leading to circulatory failure. Solutes leaking out of damaged muscles cause a spectrum of metabolic disturbances. Chief among them are hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia which, synergistically, have a lethal cardiotoxic potential, particularly in hypotensive patients. Early volume replacement, preferably already started at the rescue site, may combat shock and correct the hyperkalemia. If urine flow is established, this regimen should be followed by a forced solute-alkaline diuresis for the prevention of myoglobinuric and uricosuric acute renal failure, which is a common and ominous late complication of crush injury. Preparation for future catastrophes occurring particularly in remote regions where an 'epidemic' of crush syndrome may be forecast, should include the setting up of a radio communications network to coordinate rescue and salvage operations and the forwarding of intravenous fluid bags and lines to the disaster site. Also, it is advisable to prepare artificial kidney devices which do not require pumps and electricity and which utilize a low dialysate volume for emergency temporary use, until conventional definitive medical facilities and services have been reestablished.

102859,1990,journal of economic perspectives,on the economics of state lotteries,on the economics of state lotteries,". Dr. Mario S. Verani published a landmark article in 1990 describing the use of intravenous adenosine for stress myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. In contrast to intravenous dipyridamole, the onset of coronary vasodilation with intravenous adenosine is almost instantaneous and can be stopped readily by discontinuation of infusion. Since this seminal publication, vasodilator stress with adenosine has become a routine clinical procedure world-wide. Mario S. Verani was born on September 29, 1943 in Cantagalo, Brazil. He grew up in the nearby mountain town of Nova Friburgo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where his father was a lawyer and well-respected judge. In high school, Mario was an excellent student with a great interest in literature and writing. When Mario was 13 his 15-year old sister died from acute leukemia. This traumatic experience may have influenced his decision to apply to medical school. He was accepted at the highly competitive School of Medicine at the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (1962-1967). In medical school, Mario became reacquainted with a childhood friend Regina Rodrigues, who Mario married after her graduation. Following medical school Mario Verani was an intern in medicine at the Antonio Pedro University Hospital, Rio de Janeiro (1967) and subsequently he won a competitive research fellowship (19681970) at the Cardiovascular Research Center in Rio de Janeiro. Mario was interested in pursuing further medical training in the USA, with the intention of ultimately returning to Brazil. Mario and Regina passed the American ECFMG exam for foreignmedical graduates and both applied for medical residencies in the USA. In 1970, Mario was accepted to internal medicine residency programs in Ohio at the Daniel DrakeMemorial Hospital and Cincinnati General Hospital. During these residencies Mario became fascinated with cardiology. In 1972 Mario was accepted for a cardiology fellowship (1972-1974) at the University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City. Here Mario worked with Dr. Melvin L. Marcus, an eminent cardiologist, coronary physiologist, and director of the University of Iowa Center for Research in Ischemic Heart Disease. In parallel with Mario, Regina was able to secure training positions for herself in pathology at Cincinnati and Iowa City. After Mario had completed his cardiology training, the couple returned to Brazil. Fully trained in echocardiography, Dr. Verani was offered a position as the director of the Echocardiography Laboratory at the Hospital dos Servidores in Rio de Janeiro (1974-1976). Nevertheless, the impact of their American experience was such that within a few months after their return, Mario and Regina filed applications for USA visas, that were granted in 1976. Dr. Verani returned to Iowa City as an Associate in Cardiology at the University of Iowa Hospitals. In 1977, The History Corner Members are listed in the Acknowledgements. Reprint requests: Frans J.

This view, which suggests that greenmail prohibitions would enhance shareholder wealth, receives mixed empirical support in this paper. The average market reaction to charter amendments prohibiting greenmail payments is weakly negative, suggesting there is a value to maintaining managerial flexibility. Nonlinear maximum likelihood estimation, however, reveals a strong positive correlation between the market reaction and the firm's abnormal stock price runup over the three months just prior to the proxy mailing date. For the subsample of firms with a relatively large prior runup, the precommitment not to pay greenmail is value enhancing. If the prior runup reflects takeover rumors, then this evidence is consistent with the proposition that greenmail payments amidst takeover speculations are value decreasing. Collapse"

We discuss three problems in standard estimates of these responses and then illustrate their implications for nutrient demand relations for a poor sample from rural south India. (1) Intra-household nutrient allocations usually are ignored. In this case nutrient intakes for females systematically have algebraically lower price elasticities than do those for males, which may leave the females particularly vulnerable at times of food shortages. (2) Unobserved fixed effects may bias the estimates of responses to observed variables. In this case not only the community fixed effects on which the previous literature has focused, but also household and individual fixed effects are important. Failure to control for them results in substantial algebraically upward biases in many estimated price responses. (3) Most previous studies use current instead of permanent income, which a priori may account for the low estimated income elasticities. In this case, however, the use of permanent income does not change the conclusion that the nutrient intakes responses to income are quite small. Collapse"

Electron microscopically, the Ce techniques are the procedures of choice. In an attempt to employ all these methods for histochemical studies of ROSgenerating oxidases using a light microscope, we improved the original light microscopic Ce-DAB procedure of Angermi~ller and Fahimi (J. Histochem. Cytochem. 36, 23-8, 1988). In the present study, we report on these improved methods for amine oxidases (AOX), xanthine oxidase (XOX), D-amino oxidase (AAOX), c~-hydroxy acid oxidase (HAOX) and NADH oxidase (NADHOX); the results are compared with those obtained with the tetrazolium and coupled peroxidase techniques for AOX, XOX, AAOX and HAOX in various tissues of adult rats. The sensitivity of the original Ce-DAB method was increased by the addition of Ni or Co ions and small amounts of H202 to the DAB visualization medium. With this technique, peroxisomal and non-peroxisomal oxidase activities were found at a number of sites where they could not be observed with DAB alone. Similar or identical findings were seen for HAOX using tetrazolium (with and without artificial electron acceptors and polyvinyl alcohol) and the modified Ce-DAB method. Different results were obtained for AOX and XOX, and especially for AAOX which was detectable only with the CeDAB and coupled peroxidase procedures. Attempts to localize NADHOX with the Ce-DAB method in the light microscope failed, except for neutrophil leucocytes; NADH is preferentially hydrolysed by neudeotide pyrophosphatase. In conclusion, tetrazolium, coupled peroxidase and CeDAB procedures should be used in parallel, to obtain as much information as possible on ROS-generating oxidases in the light microscope; light microscopically, the Ce-DAB method seems to be unsuitable for NADHOX localization outside neutrophil leucocytes.

A comparison of different procedures for the estimation of Michaelis-Menten parameters in quantitative enzyme histochemistry M. Ruhnke Department of Anatomy, Free University of Berlin, Berlin, Federal Republic of Germany Quantitative enzyme histochemistry, e.g. microdensitometry, allows the determination of K~ and Vma x values in situ. These values seem to be more reliable than those determined in diluted homogenates. Nevertheless, it is important to use an error-free method for the estimation of Michaelis-Menten parameters. The linear transformations of Lineweaver-Burk, Eadie-Hofstee, and Hanes are those most widely used. For data obtained biochemically, it has been shown that several errors are associated with these procedures, and that methods such as the direct linear plot, or a direct fitting of a hyperbole to the measured data, are preferable. In order to show the relevance of these statements for quantitative enzyme histochemistry, the substrate dependence of the plasma membrane hydrolases dipeptidylpeptidase IV-glutamyl transpeptidase, unspecific alkaline phosphatase and C~-D-glucosidases were determined. For each enzyme apparent, I~ n and V .... values were estimated with the methods mentioned above. Generally, the direct linear plot and direct fitted curve were superior to other procedures. The linear transformations are helpful only when few data are available; among those, the Lineweaver-Burk plot is by far the weakest. Supported by the German Research Foundation (Sfb 174).

The value of the companies involved in such transactions increased almost sixfold between 1980 and 1986. The high rate of ownership change has stimulated growing interest (and in some cases concern) among policymakers, scholars, and the public about the causes and effects of ownership change, particularly about its effects on efficiency (hence ""competitiveness""). Some theories of ownership change, and anecdotal or fragmentary evidence concerning these changes, suggest that various kinds of ownership change-such as hostile takeovers, leveraged buyouts, and voluntary divestitures-result in reductions in administrative and managerial employment, both absolutely and relative to production employment.

The financial bailout of the two publically traded corporations came at the expense of the American tax payer. This study investigates the relationship between direct and indirect government influence and the increasing risk taking of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from the late 1990’s through their conservatorship in 2008. As government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have many special advantages that other publically traded companies did not possess. These advantages allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to increase their profitability. Theoretical literature regarding Congress and the bureaucracy suggests that the actions of bureaucrats can be linked to the preferences of Congressional members because bureaucrats are responsive to potential threats or perceived threats from the legislature. This theory is applicable to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and is used to explain why the government was able to directly and indirectly influence the government-sponsored enterprises. Overall this investigation has determined that the United States government pursued a clear mission that determined to increase the availability of housing to all Americans, specifically to low-income and under-served individuals, through the use of the government-sponsored enterprises. Despite this link there is no conclusive data to show that the pursuit of this housing mission led Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to operate in riskier business segments.

Executive branch agencies do not perfectly represent the president's will. Rather, they are constrained by the possibility that Congress may pass laws restricting their discretion. Since congressional committees serve an agenda-setting function, they will not introduce legislation if they prefer the agency's policy to the law that would be enacted by Congress. Thus agencies take account of the positions of the relevant oversight committees. Judicial review can further constrain agency behavior if the courts can void executive action. The possibility of a presidential veto and of its override by a two-thirds vote interjects an additional strategic consideration into the choices of bureaucracies, courts, and committees. Congress will seek veto-proof bills, not ones that reflect the median preference of members. Ferejohn and Shipan model the courts as just one more political actor with a set of policy goals. The judges, however, are not able to impose their own preferences when reviewing legislation. Instead, in the FerejohnShipan model, when judges strike down an agency action, the prestatutory status quo prevails. Congressional action may follow such an invalidation. According to Ferejohn and Shipan, the courts act strategically by predicting the impact of their decisions on subsequent congressional action. Collapse"

Resolutions from that meeting were later approved by the 58th World Health Assembly in Geneva. Since then, many organisations, countries, and donors have been working to deliver on those recommendations. In November this year, an even broader group of ministers and other stakeholders will gather in Bamako, Mali, to assess progress and determine new priorities. The 2008 Global Ministerial Forum on Research for Health will provide a unique platform for ministers of health, science and technology, and social development to discuss research with global experts and stakeholders. Refl ecting this diversity, and the broad vision of research for health, the meeting is being co-organised by a partnership involving the Council on Health Research for Development (COHRED), Global Forum for Health Research, Government of Mali, UNESCO, World Bank, and WHO. On the road to Bamako 2008, it is appropriate to refl ect on where we have been, what progress we have made, and where we wish to go in the future. In 1990, the Commission on Health Research for Development noted that only 5% of global spending on health research went to problems aff ecting the poorest 93% of the world’s people, now known as the “10/90 gap”. The Commission recommended investment in essential national health research, inter national partnerships, and mechanisms to monitor progress, and noted that “research should not be limited to the health sector, but should also examine the health impact of development in other sectors and the socioeconomic determinants of health”. The Commission’s pivotal report was followed in 1993 by the World Bank’s World development report: investing in health, and by the establishment of COHRED to promote the conduct and use of essential health research in developing countries. In 1996, WHO’s Ad Hoc Committee on Health Research Relating to Future Intervention Options identifi ed best buys for investment, including research on maternal and child health, microbial threats, health systems, noncommunicable diseases, and injuries. The Global Forum for Health Research was created in 1998 to advocate for greater invest ments in health research to meet the needs of poor people. In 2000, the Global Forum’s annual meeting was co-convened with WHO and the World Bank in Bangkok, Thailand, subsumed under an International Conference on Health Research for Development, in which COHRED had a leading organisational role. Participants emphasised the strengthening of national health research systems as a key priority to reduce the 10/90 gap. 4 years after the Bangkok meeting, the Global Forum’s eighth annual meeting was held in Mexico City in parallel with the Ministerial Summit on Health Research organised by WHO. The two overlapping events focused on research to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Ministers attending the summit committed to three key priorities: health-systems research, securing public confi dence in research, and bridging the gap between knowledge and action. These developments might have helped to stimulate the recent explosion of innovative new ideas and initiatives in global health. In this context, two additional phenomena deserve mention. First, some innovative developing countries (IDCs) such as Brazil, China, India, and South Africa have become important producers of low-cost drugs and vaccines. Second, donors and developing countries have both begun, rightly, to embrace science and technology as key drivers of social and economic development. So what progress have we made?

I concur with Moe's view that political scientists of the ""new institutionalist"" genre have given disproportionate attention to legislatures as compared with bureaucracies and that a more balanced approach that ""tackles the subject of bureaucracy in a serious way"" (Moe, 1990b:S250) is needed. Furthermore, I concur with the eight points of inquiry that he prescribes (Moe, 1990b:S250-S251). My own sense of the best way to reorient a field is to address the neglected questions and to offer insights and answers with which ""orthodoxy"" must come to terms. Moe's comparison of the American separation-ofpowers system with the parliamentary systems of other Western democracies-in terms both of the differences in their politics of structural choice and differences in the bureaucracies-is in that spirit.

We find that the shadow price of CO2 varies greatly between US$1.49 and US$288.82, depending on the company’s production strategy concerning energy supply and CO2 emissions. These shadow prices give us clues to understand how the electric power companies may respond to environmental regulations, such as environmental tax and emission trading systems. According to the DODF, an additional 53571 GWh of electricity could have been generated in 2011 at the cost of an increase of 40105 thousand tonnes of CO2, if the companies would have operated efficiently giving little consideration to CO2 emissions reduction. These increases are equivalent to 8.77 and 9.18 % of total electricity and CO2 emissions, respectively, from the ten electric power companies in 2011. On the other hand, if the companies would have operated efficiently and given first priority to CO2 emissions reduction, a further 58002 thousand tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 13.28 % of their total CO2 emissions in 2011, could have been reduced as a whole.

Second, assuming a variety of possible firm objectives, what would be the design of an efficient window plan? These questions are addressed using the retirement model in Stock and Wise [1988a, 1988b] . The model, estimated using data for an earlier year, predicts well out-of-sample the subsequent large increase in retirements under the window plan. We find that while the firm successfully maximized departures, if its goal was to minimize either expected future wage payments or the current cost per induced retirement, the firm could have saved more with efficient plans constructed using the model. One interpretation is that the firm was primarily interested in reducing the overall size of the labor force or in retiring older employees to allow promotion of younger employees. Collapse"

Maternal deaths are clustered around labour, delivery, and the immediate postpartum period, with obstetric haemorrhage being the main medical cause of death. Local variation can be important, with unsafe abortion carrying huge risk in some populations, and HIV/AIDS becoming a leading cause of death where HIV-related mortaliy rates are high.

EDGAR data provide quantitative support for atmospheric modelling and for mitigation scenario and impact assessment analyses as well as for policy evaluation. The new version (v4.3.2) of the EDGAR emission inventory provides global estimates, broken down to IPCC-relevant source-sector levels, from 1970 (the year of the European Union’s first Air Quality Directive) to 2012 (the end year of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, KP). Strengths of EDGAR v4.3.2 include global geo-coverage (226 countries), continuity in time, and comprehensiveness in activities. Emissions of multiple chemical compounds, GHGs as well as air pollutants, from relevant sources (fossil fuel activities but also, for example, fermentation processes in agricultural activities) are compiled following a bottom-up (BU), transparent and IPCC-compliant methodology. This paper describes EDGAR v4.3.2 developments with respect to three major long-lived GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) derived from a wide range of human activities apart from the land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector and apart from savannah burning; a companion paper quantifies and discusses emissions of air pollutants. Detailed information is included for each of the IPCC-relevant source sectors, leading to global totals for 2010 (in the middle of the first KP commitment period) (with a 95 % confidence interval in parentheses): 33.6(±5.9) Pg CO2 yr−1, 0.34(±0.16) Pg CH4 yr−1, and 7.2(±3.7) Tg N2O yr−1. We provide uncertainty factors in emissions data for the different GHGs and for three different groups of countries: OECD countries of 1990, countries with economies in transition in 1990, and the remaining countries in development (the UNFCCC nonAnnex I parties). We document trends for the major emitting countries together with the European Union in more Published by Copernicus Publications. 960 G.

At the time the UNFCCC was established, the 24 members of the OECD in 1990 and 16 other European countries and Russia were considered liable for “the largest share of historical and current global emissions of GHG” and taken up in Annex I to the UNFCCC. These Annex I countries and the European Union1 submit annually complete inventories of GHG emissions from the 1990 base year2 until the latest year for which full accounting is completed and reviewed (typically with a 2-year time lag), and these inventories are all reviewed to ensure transparency, completeness, comparability, consistency and accuracy3. This allows for most of these Annex I countries to track progress towards their reduction targets committed under the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC, 1997). Other (non-Annex I) countries are encouraged to submit their GHG inventories as part of their National Communications and Biennial Update Reports (BURs). The GHG inventories of nonAnnex I countries were required to cover CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions for 1 year (1990 or 1994), without specific documentation and only subject to a brief review. However, the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2015) requires submission every 2 years of BURs4, which are subject to international consultation and analysis. Theoretically, UNFCCC should receive at the latest after 2 years national emissions inventories from each of the 197 countries, but as shown in Fig. 1a, not all countries did provide a national inventory and 154 countries did not provide a completed (i.e. year-2) time se1This includes the 28 Member States of the European Union (EU) as of 1 July 2013. 2For some economies in transition, another year such as 1988 or 1989 can be chosen under UNFCCC as the base year. These GHG emissions are mainly sources, but also include carbon stock sinks for which the human-induced part needs to be assessed with care (Grassi et al., 2018). 3These five principles of a good reporting practice are defined in the UNFCCC guidelines for national GHG inventory, e.g. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3c30/ a1bd769dee5299746e0af825c7ab4ed55fba.pdf. EDGAR uses the term “comprehensiveness” to summarise these principles. 4The first BUR submitted should cover the inventory for the year no more than 4 years prior to the submission data, and subsequent BURs should be submitted every 2 years, but flexibility is given to the least developed countries and small island developing states. ries of inventories. In addition, many countries lack a welldeveloped statistical infrastructure, which is needed for an accurate bottom-up (BU) inventory. Figure 1b presents the latest year that is covered with a national inventory, with dates for quite a few countries more than 10 years ago: for most South-East Asian countries this is between 2004 and 2007 and for most African countries between 2000 and 2003. As such, the collection of national reports/communications does not provide a complete, consistent and comparable global dataset which can be used to understand the global budgets of the most important GHG emissions and their impact on climate. Very few bottom-up inventories of global anthropogenic emissions have been produced with continued effort for more than 2 decades. The Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC) (Boden et al., 2017; Andres et al., 2014) and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) (Olivier and Janssens-Maenhout, 2016; Olivier et al., 2016) provide global totals, whereas the IEA provides CO2 estimates from fuel combustion only and the FAO CH4 from agriculture only. While CDIAC ceased operation in September 2017, the Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC) (Oda et al., 2018) continued to use the CDIAC data and combined these with geospatial proxies (including night light satellite maps) to provide CO2 grid maps, as EDGAR is also doing (using other geospatial proxies). In addition, the new Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) of Hoesly et al. (2018) builds upon existing inventories to provide a new gridded dataset of all emission species for the Climate Model Inter-comparison Programme CMIP6. The scientific community started to bring together these anthropogenic BU emissions with top-down estimates covering also the natural component to obtain the Global Carbon Budget (GCB) (Le Quéré et al., 2018) and the Global Methane Budget (Saunois et al., 2016). These budgets are important input for the periodic global stocktake that the Paris Agreement envisages from 2023 onwards (with the submitted inventories for 2021). Even though significant progress in inventory compilation has been made, the overall uncertainty of the global total has become larger over time because the share of emissions from non-Annex I countries (with less developed statistical infrastructure) increased from less than 40 % in 1990 to more than 60 % in 2012, as shown in Fig. 2.

Furthermore, the monthly resolution and global grid maps at a spatial resolution of 0.1× 0.1 allow direct use in atmospheric models as well as in analyses of policy impacts.

First, we examined the influences of IT on the firm’s IT advantage over its competitors. Second, the relationship between IT and competitive strategy was examined. The results show that IT has a significant influence on a firm’s IT advantage and its competitive strategy. INTRODUCTION Information technology (IT) offers opportunities to provide competitive operation advantages like logistical efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility (Sanders & Premus, 2002). Yet, due to the high cost of IT and lack of expertise, the IT adoption rate of logistics users is still low (Sum, Teo, & Ng, 2001). One implication of this low IT adoption rate for firms which use logistics is that there are ample opportunities for third-party logistics (3PL) firms to adopt IT and exploit this aspect of their services (Bhatnagar, Sohal & Millen, 1999). Rapid expansion within a company, coupled with continued growth in logistics requirements, also encourages logistics users to outsource their logistics activities to 3PL firms (Sum et al.). Logistics outsourcing, through 3PL firms, has become a rapidly expanding source of competitive advantage and logistics cost savings (Rabinovich, Windle, Dresner & Corsi, 1999). Many Fortune-500 companies have now outsourced transportation, warehouse, and inventory management functions (Burnson, 2000). IT in a 3PL firm plays an essential role in synchronizing and coordinating complex supply chain activities between logistics users and their customers and is therefore an important strategic capability for 3PL firms. Although there are limited studies addressing how 3PL firms build high level IT capability, those that have recognize the inherent difficulties (Lewis & Talalayevski, 2000; Stone, 2001). Previous studies of IT have mainly focused on the value of IT, such as cost reduction and productivity improvement. Only limited studies have investigated the relationships that may exist between IT and the strategy that a company pursues. We examine these issues within 3PL firms F. Lai, K. Zantow, D. Li & Q. Wang 2008 Volume 17, Numbers 3/4 248 in China. China’s 3PL firms represent a unique opportunity to address issues related to IT and strategy. The entry of China into the World Trade Organization (WTO) has resulted in tremendous growth in business within China, and the logistics industry there is growing. Increased competition in China’s logistics industry has forced many 3PLs to review their strategies, and the value propositions they represent to their clients. Our paper proceeds as follows. We first present a review of the literature, followed by discussion our research methodology. Next we present results of the analysis, and discuss our findings and limitations. Finally, we present our conclusions. LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESE Within the logistics literature, IT plays an important role and has been promoted as a means to enhance logistics competitiveness (Bowersox & Daugherty, 1995; Daugherty, Ellinger & Rogers, 1995), increase capability, decrease cost, and improve service (Closs, Goldsby & Clinton, 1997). Although IT was considered a key component in future logistics systems (Dawe, 1994) and showed growth trends in logistics, many managers still caution the use of IT, due to high technology cost (e.g., DRP systems and satellite communications systems), risk of organizational damage during implementation, and lack of demonstrated effectiveness (Sum et al., 2001). Other reasons for organizations’ hesitancy to invest in IT include the expected obsolescence of hardware and software, application redundancy, and irrelevance of applications to a firm’s particular industry and information needs (Dawe, 1994). Bowersox, Daugherty, Dröge, Rogers and Wardlow (1989) refers to logistics managers’ inability or unwillingness to adopt IT, despite the influence applications may have on firm success/failure, as the “information gap”. We are interested in the relationship of those factors to the strategy that a firm pursues, and to perceived IT advantage. The model is presented in Figure 1. IT Strategic Posture We represent IT strategic posture as being composed of: the importance placed on IT (IT Importance hereafter), the degree of resource effort devoted to IT (IT Effort hereafter), and the managerial involvement in the strategic planning (IT Involvement hereafter) (c.f., Wang, Lai, & Zhao, 2008; Lai, Wang & Zhao, 2006). The relationships between these three components are not the focus of the present study, which had been examined in Wang et al. (2008) and Lai et al. (2006). However, to make the model appropriately specified and avoid potential biases of parameter estimations, we still incorporate the relationships into our model. Therefore, we have: H1a: IT importance has significant and positive influences on IT Efforts H1b: IT importance has significant and positive influences on IT Involvement Linking IT & Competitive Strategy Journal of International Technology and Information Management 249 Figure 1: The Research Model. IT Advantage IT strategy must be integrated with the overall corporate strategy and united with all the organization's other competitive strategies. All levels of management must develop competitive strategies that emphasize the central role of IT (Mattson, Beheshti & Salehi-Sangari, 2000). Strategy alignment theory emphasizes top management participation for aligning IT strategies and business strategies. An alignment between its IT and business strategies enables an organization to acquire, deploy, and leverage its IT investments and capabilities effectively in pursuit of its business strategies and in support of its business activities (Reich & Benbasat, 2000; Hirschheim & Sabherwal, 2001). This alignment might be facilitated through an understanding of the overall organizational objectives by top management. Lederer and Burky (1989) showed that IT executives who participate more in strategic planning believe that they have a better understanding of top management's objectives than do those who participate less. Zmud (1988) argued that structural mechanisms (e.g., steering committees, technology transfer groups) associated with communications and management systems (e.g., planning and control mechanisms) are needed to build IT-line partnerships for the successful introduction of new technologies. Boynton et al. (1994) also suggests that the effective application of IT depends on the interactions and exchanges that bind IT and line managers. Therefore we hypothesize: H2a: IT involvement has significant and positive influences on IT advantage Top management championship, including top management beliefs and participation, may also determinately influence IT adoption and assimilation (Chatterjee et al., 2002). Top management championship is a metastructuring action which defines institutional norms and values regarding how managers should engage in structuring actions related to IT (Chatterjee et al., 2002). F. Lai, K. Zantow, D. Li & Q. Wang 2008 Volume 17, Numbers 3/4 250 Chatterjee et al. (2002) defined top management championship in terms of managerial beliefs about IT initiatives and participation in those initiatives. In firms where top managers believe that IT offers a strategic opportunity and actively participate in the IT initiatives, their beliefs and participation serve as powerful signals to others in the managerial community about the importance placed on IT adoption and assimilation. Through their beliefs, top management can offer vision and guidelines to managers about the opportunities and risks in assimilating IT innovation. Further, top management can legitimize the willingness and energy of managers to commit their effort to IT adoption (Chatterjee et al., 2002). Studies demonstrated that the top management beliefs and participation significantly influence the web assimilation (e.g. Chatterjee et al., 2002). Therefore, we believe that top management beliefs and participation in IT can promote and improve IT advantage and capability. H2b: IT importance has significant and positive influences on IT advantage. Goal theory suggests that effort is the most immediate determinant of performance (Locke et al., 1988). Kren (1990) proposes an extended expectancy theory model that combines expectancy theory and goal theory. In this model, greater effort to reach an objective leads to better performance. Meanwhile, higher levels of resource commitment may help a firm to acquire such competitive IT equipments as hardware, software, network, and databases. Together with appropriate strategic integration with business objectives, the competitive IT equipments may facilitate the achievement of IT advantage over competitors. Therefore, we hypothesize: H2c: IT effort has significant and positive influences on IT advantage. Competitive Strategy In Porter’s (1980, 1985) view, competitive advantage comes from either being able to reduce costs below the industry average or through differentiating products or services in some way that would entice customers to pay above average prices for the product or service. Porter (1980) referred to these as cost leadership and differentiation strategies. IT can be seen as a tangible resource that is commonly available, which may contribute to the success of a company pursuing either a cost leadership or differentiation strategy (Hill, 1988). IT affects the competitive advantage of a company (Lea, 2005; Evans & Neu, 2008) by influencing the cost drivers or uniqueness drivers of value chain activities (Porter, 1985). Internal processes and activities, as resources, are used by companies as methods of increasing communications, quality, and performance (Fedorowicz et al., 2004; Whitten, 2004). Although IT may help firms to achieve differentiation and cost leadership, the logistics literature has shown that firms that Collapse"

Furthermore, monetary surprises had no statistically discernible effect on the share prices of these banks. This evidence conflicts with the notion that rational rent-seeking would lead the owners of member banks and their bureaucratic conspirators in the Federal Reserve System to unleash a policy with the goal of contracting the money supply by 35 percent.

In that article we advanced an hypothesis of Fed behavior grounded in the political self-interests of the banking system's regulators and their overseers in Congress. Specifically, we argued that the Fed obtained two important benefits from the massive contraction in the money supply over which it presided between late 1929 and the middle of 1930. First, because of the differentially higher failure rates of nonmember banks during this period, the proportion of the commercial banking industry under the Fed's control increased dramatically. The second benefit came in the form of a change in the Fed's method of finance which freed the Board of Governors from the normal congressional budgetary process. Putting the Great Contraction in interest-group terms, we suggested that during 1929-1933, the Fed was acting rationally as the agent of congressmen serving on important oversight committees who, in turn, were representing the interests of the member banks in their states and districts. We tested this hypothesis using bank failure rate data across states and found that, holding other things equal, the failure rates of nonmember banks in the early 1930s were significantly higher in states with representation on the House Banking Collapse"

Although cereal producers were initially prohibited from advertising these health benefits, the regulatory ban against producer advertising was lifted during the period we study. Our results indicate that consumers changed their behavior once informed of the health benefits and that advertising was an important source of information once the ban was lifted. Producer health claims about fiber also led to significant product innovation and did not cause adverse effects in other health dimensions of cereal consumption. Government and general information sources had limited impact on fiber cereal choices in the years prior to the advertising. Analysis of individual food consumption data indicates that theories of information acquisition are important in explaining who responds most quickly to new information; household and individual characteristics that reflect costs of acquiring information, ability to process information, and valuation of health are all important determinants of fiber cereal choices. Moreover, the evidence suggests that advertising reduced the differences across consumers by lowering the costs of acquiring information for broad segments of the population.

The restructuring of local government is especially significant in the context of South Africa's emerging democracy. A key component of this process has been boundary delimitation, which involved a process of spatial organisation and re-organisation. In South Africa the de-racialisation of local government represents a major challenge. Many affluent white local authorities were reluctant to give up the power and privileges of the old order and merge with previously black local authorities. Also, the socio-spatial distortions of the apartheid era need to be addressed through a more equitable distribution of resources, and the re-drawing of geographical boundaries. Attempts at municipal restructuring in South Africa have been fraught with problems and conflicts. The conflicts engendered, the negotiations, compromises, and coalitions generated constitute important areas of research. Examining and elucidating the manner in which these various forces have manifested themselves in the major metropolitan centres is the central theme of this paper. The focus of this paper is on boundary delimitation in the Durban Metropolitan area. Introduction Countries undergoing political and economic transition have placed a strong emphasis on the development of a viable and effective system of local government (Mawhood, 1993; Maharaj, 1997). A critical issue is the “nature of local territorially-based communities and their potential for democratic self-governance within the complex political and economic environment” (Sancton, 1996:277). The restructuring of local government has been primarily “influenced by economic, technological, political and ideological change”, and can “modify spatial patterns of development and disparities” (Razin, 2000:7). In South Africa the de-racialisation of local government represents a major challenge. 1 Paper presented in the IASTE conference “[un]bounding traditions: the tensions of borders and regions” held in Honk-Kong (December 2002) “Rencontres de l’innovation territoriale 2 The restructuring of local government is especially significant in the context of South Africa's emerging democracy, especially since this transformation ""has taken place in a way that is probably unique from an international comparative perspective"" (Swilling, Monteiro and Johnson, 1995:16). A key component of this process has been spatial re-organisation through boundary delimitation. However, boundaries are not neutral geographic lines. Boundary changes are often associated with a redistribution of political power and resources, with some institutions and parties benefiting, and others being disadvantaged (Alexander, 1982; Hasson and Razin, 1990; Keating, 1995; Cameron, 1999). Quite often boundary conflicts are associated with urban municipalities encroaching into rural areas. Unless there are redistributive transfers, urban-rural inequalities are accentuated (Razin, 2000). In a process of territorial restructuring, there are potential areas of dispute, which often reveal local, regional and national geopolitical stakes (Hasson and Razin, 1990). Therefore, local and regional spatial restructuring led to contestations and conflicts over the delimitation of new boundaries in South Africa (Ramutsindela and Simon, 1999; Narsiah and Maharaj, 1997; 1999; Ramutsindela, 2001). The conflicts engendered, the negotiations, compromises, and coalitions generated constitute important areas of research. The aim of this paper is to analyse the effects of the contemporary territorial and administrative restructuring on urban dynamics in South Africa. More specifically, the focus is on how the process of territorial restructuring impacted on metropolitan areas as well as their hinterlands. The political and economic implications associated with attempts to extend urban boundaries into rural areas will also be assessed. It is important to understand how boundary rationalisation and political power intersect. The nature, size, composition and governance of regions are constantly changing depending on the balance of societal forces and the dominant mode of accumulation (Markusen, 1978). Political, territorial and administrative reorganisation therefore needs to be theorised in terms of the articulation of a number of structures including those associated with ideology, bureaucracy, nationalism, gender and regimes of accumulation (Driver, 1991; Murphy, 1991). “Rencontres de l’innovation territoriale 3 Local Government in Transition in South Africa Since the 1990s South Africa embarked on the long journey towards reconstruction, development and planning in the post-apartheid era. Success would depend on a sensitive understanding of the ""geographical legacy of apartheid and the scars it has left behind, and also to the complex local, regional and environmental diversity that characterises the South African whole"" (McCarthy, 1991:23). The contemporary South African city is reflective of a discourse of apartheid urban planning characterised by racially fragmented and discontinuous land use and settlement patterns, haphazard, dysfunctional and inefficient spatial ordering, land use mismatches, low level population density and the concentration of the poor in relatively high density areas on the peripheries and the rich in the core intermediate urban areas (Hindson et al, 1992:6). Local government in the apartheid city was characterised by a ""complex process of functional inclusion, spatial separation, and political exclusion"" (Swilling, et al. 1991:175). In the democratic era the Local Government Transition Act (LGTA) of 1994 provided an institutional base for the disbanding of race-based municipalities, scrapping of apartheid laws relating to local government, and the establishment of transitional local councils (Khan and Maharaj, 1997). About 1 260 local authorities were merged to form 843 municipalities. However, the type of local government that materialised in terms of the LGTA did not ""necessarily support the notion of 'one city' or 'one tax base'"" (Wooldridge, 2002:132). In many areas the spatial inscription which prescribes the separation of areas of abject poverty from areas of affluence persists (Narsiah and Maharaj, 1999). For example, there was a tendency to exclude ""settlements on the periphery of the metropolis which would lower the per capita tax base, and place a strain on service delivery capacity"" (Wooldridge, 2002:132). Furthermore, ""hastily drawn municipal boundaries and negotiated ward boundaries produced a fragmented system, with metropolitan areas divided into impractical substructures, and some small towns and rural areas cut up like a patchwork quilt"" (Cashden, 2002:162). “Rencontres de l’innovation territoriale 4 In an attempt to address these problems the White Paper on Local Government provided the foundation for a new developmental local government (DLG) system (Government Gazette, 13/3/98, p. 15). It introduced the notion of the ‘wall to wall principle’ in order to ensure that all the parts of the country, including the poor rural peripheries, will be integrated in the new demarcation process. DLG exhorts local authorities to focus on achieving developmental outcomes, such as the provision of basic infrastructure and services; the creation of integrated cities and livable environments; the encouragement of local economic development initiatives; and the empowerment of communities. Three inter-linked approaches to help municipalities to effectively play a developmental role were proposed: ""integrated development planning and budgeting; performance management; and working together with local citizens and partners"" (Government Gazette, 13/3/98, p.16). An important strategy to help municipalities to become more developmental is integrated development planning (IDP). Integrated development planning depends on the coordination of a range of services and regulations, including land-use planning, household infrastructure, environmental management, transport, health and education, safety and security and housing (Government Gazette, 13 March 1998, p.39). The type of municipal institutions that would best suit South African conditions was the subject of considerable discussion. The issue of their shape, size, and boundaries was directly linked to the socio-economic dynamics. There were two different perspectives with regard to metropolitan government. For those who were interested in the growth imperative metropolitan government plays a pivotal role in promoting economic development because it provides a more effective regional infrastructure for reproducing labour power as well as promoting production and distribution; offered tax exemptions and subsidies to attract investment; and facilitated the establishment of pro-growth partnerships with the private sector. Those who favoured the equity focus argued that metropolitan government could promote more equitable land use; ensure fairer taxation; improve efficiency, service provision and capacity; reduce socio-spatial inequalities and foster rational planning (PLANACT, 1992; Government Gazette, 13/3/98, pp.81-84). In South Africa the White Paper on Local Government defined metropolitan areas as follows: Metropolitan areas are large urban settlements with high population densities, complex and diversified economies, and a high degree of functional integration across a larger geographic “Rencontres de l’innovation territoriale 5 area than the normal jurisdiction of a municipality. Economic and social activities transcend municipal boundaries, and metropolitan residents may live in one locality, work in another, and utilise recreational facilities across the metropolitan area (Government Gazette, 13/3/98, p.78).

In this paper, we submit these models to further scrutiny by testing whether they exhibit (structural) stability. A series of tests, recently developed by Ghysels and Hall (1990), are applied and a test for structuralinvariance is introduced based on the likelihood ratio type test procedure of Eichenbaum, Hansen, and Singleton (1988). There are a number of reasons why structural stability tests are particularly appropriate for diagnostic testing of Euler equation models, namely: (1) the Lucas econometric policy evaluation critique; (2) Euler equations are only a partial description of the data-generating process and parameter stability is one of the few assumptions imposed in their estimation via the generalized method of moments; and finally (3) it is demonstrated that Hansen's overidentifying restrictions test has no power against a class of local alternatives characterized by a parameter drift.

Once set in motion, it led to a revolutionary re-evaluation of human aspirations and economic activities. Among its many consequences, it has stimulated creative minds to look freshly at the underlying processes governing the wealth and welfare of nations. The article then traces their creative impact on the mind of one of the most original economic theorists of our age – Orio Giarini.* As ‘The Limits to Growth’ alarmed the world by the unsustainability and dire consequences of unbridled economic growth, Giarini offers a correspondingly affirmative vision of economics with unlimited potential for wealth and welfare.† Forty years ago was a crucial turning point in human affairs, though it was poorly understood, disputed and even denied at that time. Three events stand out for their particular significance: the end of the Gold Standard in 1971, the publication of The Limits to Growth in 1972, and the first oil crisis in 1973. They marked the end of an era of rapid economic development for the industrialized countries, unalloyed optimism and unquestioned faith in capitalism, the beginning of a period of increasing doubt and uncertainty, which has now culminated in a multi-dimensional crisis of unparalleled proportions. Since then, the world has been wracked by increasing financial instability demarcated by more than 200 monetary currency crises and 145 large-scale banking crises. The average growth rate in Western Europe declined progressively from 6.1% in the 50s to 4.8% in the 60s and 2.3% in the 70s, then fell to less than 2% since 1990. The initial quadrupling of oil prices, an alarming reminder that non-renewable resources are actually non-renewable, spurred price inflation in the late 70s, which was only kept under control by tight monetary policy, slower growth, and rising levels of unemployment and income inequality in the decades that followed. * The events described in this narrative of the early history of the Club of Rome are based on a chapter in Orio Giarini’s French autobiography, Itinerary Towards Retirement at 80, ( in French : “La retraite à 8o ans “ ), Economica – Paris, 2003. † The attack was on growth as defined quantitatively and measured by GDP.

The findings confirm many of the beliefs expressed by Granger (1986) and Engle and Yoo (1987) based on theoretical consideration of the ECM model versus the VAR model.

The incompetent patient requires an advocate, a responsibility that generally falls upon the family. If a conflict over a patient arises within the family, the result may well be inimical to effective patient management. On June 25th, 1990, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in Cruzan v Director, Missouri Department of Health, the first case in which the high court considered the termination of life-prolonging measures for incompetent patients. In a 5-4 decision, the Court upheld the decision by the Missouri Supreme Court that the feeding tube of Nancy Cruzan, a patient in a persistent vegetative state since 1983 could not be removed at the request of her parents. The reason was that there was no ’clear and convincing’ evidence that the patient when competent had specifically indicated that she would not wish to be tube-fed if she ever became irreversibly unconscious. The narrow import of the decision in Cruzan must be stressed. The Court ruled that it is constitutionally permissible for a state to require that life-prolonging measures for an incompetent patient remain in place unless the patient had left behind a clear directive excluding such measures in the event of a future state of incompetency. The Court did not rule that such a state rule is mandatory but simply that a state may so rule if it chooses. The decision in Cruzan thus leaves intact the long line of cases, beginning with In the Matter of Karen Quinlan, in which state supreme courts have held that decisions to terminate life-prolonging treatment for incompetent patients should rest with the patient’s family and physicians. The courts have further ruled that the courtroom should be the forum of last resort for decision-making involving the tennination of life-prolonging treatment for incompetent patients. In the view of the judges, however, they have a roIe to play when there is in-family conflict that cannot be resolved in the health care setting. In that event, judicial action is called for in which either the court makes the treatment decision or else vests that authority in a guardian appointed to act on the patient’s behalf. (The trend in the more recent cases is to assign the decision to a guardian, not to the court itself.) The “Daughter from California Syndrome” describes one such in-family predicament. In this case an adult daughter, who had not seen her mother for 5 years, appeared on the scene when critical health care options were being considered for her incompetent mother. Upon being confronted with her mother’s condition, the daughter responded with acute denial as well as anger and resentment directed against the medical staff. She refused to come to terms with her mother’s condition, demanded inappropriate aggressive care, and impeded the management of the case. offer a possibIe soIution to these problems by allowing competent individuals to choose their own health care before they become incompetent.

In both countries, poverty decreased rapidly between the mid‐1960s and the mid‐1970s, after which changes have been less dramatic. During the first part of the 1980s poverty continued to decrease in Finland, but increased in Sweden. Comparisons for age‐groups showed large reductions in poverty rates among the aged in both countries. Poverty has shifted from the permanent old age poverty towards a more temporary poverty in young adulthood. International comparisons show that in the early 1980s both Finland and Sweden had poverty rates below the average of the affluent Western nations. Furthermore, these comparisons suggest that cross‐national variations in poverty rates are partly explained by the size of the welfare state. Also, time series analysis shows that income transfers have taken an increasing number of people out of poverty in both countries. Collapse"
103597,1990,review of income and wealth,netting out income taxes for different types of income of households,netting out income taxes for different types of income of households,"Income is not a well-defined term either in economic statistics or in economic theory. In the national accounts certain definitions of income have been convened and internationally standardised, but the ongoing debate about the coming revision of the United Nations' SNA has shown that different views continue to exist as regarding the conceptual background and the systemic embedding of those definitions. One issue in this context is the distinction between income paid and income received within a pair of economic transactors. Income is a classical area of government interference in the circuit of economic flows for the purpose of partly correcting the original income distribution, partly of financing its own spending. A view of national accounts shows the difficulties that occur based on the fact that the simple theoretic equality of income paid and income received is not valid in many economic fields. The most conspicuous case is that of indirect taxes, which form part of value added, i.e. income originated in production, but not assigned to either of the production factors. Although this is an old and well-known case and its implications have been accepted in national accounting, they have hardly been reflected in economic theory or political practice. Even less attention has been devoted to the case of direct taxes although in quantitative terms it is equally relevant. The question is simple. A gap between income paid and income received is generated by direct taxes as well as by indirect taxes so that one would like to know the true net result. What amount remains with the households of each type of income after the government has interfered? For economic analysis the opposition of income from labour and income from capital, each being netted from its direct tax component may be of interest. The income politics of trade unions and of employers can hardly result in decent compromises if the different view points from which income paid and income received must be studied are not taken into account. In the Federal Republic of Germany a concept of ""net compensation of employees"" was developed in connection with the early national accounts, although neither of the relevant international systems recommend it. It was later complemented by the concept of ""net entrepreneurial and property income."" Also transfer incomes were balanced against their share of income tax (Hamer, 1964). It seems that similar ideas are being pursued in the United Kingdom (Central Statistical Office, 1988). The fact that such compilations have not become Collapse"
103598,1990,review of income and wealth,units in national accounts and the basic system of economic statistics,units in national accounts and the basic system of economic statistics,"Units which are actually used in legal-administrative reality often are not directly suitable as statistical units. For the purposes of the statistical description of the economic processes a transformation is needed. In this paper I examine the consequences of a changing legal-administrative reality to the definition of statistical units, particularly in the light of the SNA revision now under way. The National Accounts comprise a schematic description of the economic processes that constitute a national economy. This implies that a multi-form actual situation is stylized and reduced to quantifiable simplicity in accordance with a set of definitions and definition equations which in turn are based on underlying economic theories. Traditionally, in the National Accounts two main lines can be distinguished. One is aimed at the description of production processes. The other one focuses on the estimation of macroeconomic data such as national income, etc. or on the description of how these macro-aggregates are generated, distributed and spent. For both approaches it can be said that they lead to a description of reality which is not objective and which, if considered from another point of view, incorporates certain distortions. These are a consequence of the axioms and definitions of the underlying theories and the way in which they are made operational. According to Archipof (1985) National Accounts data are created as a projection of basic data, a projection which involves aggregation and transformation processes. In this view the transformation processes are based on a set of a priori equations which determine the coherence of the system and establish which confrontations must be made. The commodity flow method can be seen as an example of this. It starts out from the equivalence of the sum of production and imports to the sum of consumption, investment, exports and changes in stocks. Depending on the set of equations chosen several National Accounts systems can be realised. It must be stressed though, that National Accounts are meant to be a description of economic reality. The transformations necessary to realise a description of reality relate to a variety of aspects; for example, the description of economic agents and the deeds of these agents.

103605,1990,review of income and wealth,aspects of poverty in greece,aspects of poverty in greece,"Dependence of damage estimates upon assumptions of economic growth and technological development Greater economic growth could, by increasing emissions, lead to greater damages from climate change. On the other hand, by increasing wealth and advancing technological development and human capital, economic growth would also increase a society's adaptive capacity and reduce those damages. Although analyses of the impacts (or damages) of climate change generally incorporate economic growth into the emissions and climate change scenarios that they use as inputs, these analyses do not adequately account for the increase in adaptive capacity resulting from that very growth. Because of this inconsistency, these analyses generally tend to overstate impacts. For instance, the average GDP per capita for developing countries in 2100 is projected to be $11,000 (in 1990 US$, at market exchange rates) under A2, the slowest economic growth scenario, and $66,500 under A1, the scenario with both the greatest economic growth and largest climate change. By comparison, in 1990 the GDP per capita for Greece, for example, was $8,300 while Switzerland, the country with the highest income level at that time, had a GDP per capita of $34,000. Based on historical experience, one should expect that at the high levels of GDP per capita projected by the IPCC scenarios in 2100, wealth-driven increases in adaptive capacity alone should virtually eliminate damages from many climate-sensitive hazards, e.g., malaria and hunger, whether or not these damages are caused by climate change. Current damage estimates are inflated further because they usually do not adequately account for secular (time-dependent) improvements in technology that, if history is any guide, ought to occur in the future unrelated to economic development. A compelling argument for reducing greenhouse gases is that it would help developing countries cope with climate change. It is asserted that they need this help because their adaptive capacity is weak. Although often true today, this assertion becomes increasingly invalid in the future if developing countries become wealthier and more technologically advanced, per the IPCC's scenarios. Damage assessments frequently overlook this. Are scenario storylines internally consistent in light of historical experience? Regardless of whether the economic growth assumptions used in the IPCC scenarios are justified, their specifications regarding the relationship between wealth and technological ability are, in general, inconsistent with the lessons of economic history. They assume that the less wealthy societies depicted by the B1 and B2 scenarios would have greater environmental protection and employ cleaner and more efficient technologies than the wealthier society characterized by the A1F1 scenario. This contradicts general experience in the real world, where richer countries usually have cleaner technologies. Under the IPCC scenarios, the richer A1 world has the same population as the poorer B1 world, but in fact total fertility rates — a key determinant of population growth rates — are, by and large, lower for richer nations and, over time, have dropped for any given level of GDP per capita (Goklany 2001a). Merits of reallocating expenditures from mitigation to international development Halting climate change at its 1990 level would annually cost substantially more than the $165 billion estimated for the minimally-effective Kyoto Protocol. According to DEFRA-sponsored studies, in 2085, which is at the limit of the foreseeable future, such a halt would reduce the total global population at risk (PAR) due to both climate change and non-climate-change-related causes by 3 percent for malaria, 21 percent for hunger, and 86 percent for coastal flooding, although the total PAR for water shortage might well increase. The benefits associated with halting climate change — and more — can be obtained more economically through “focused adaptation”, i.e., activities focused on reducing vulnerabilities to the above noted climate-sensitive hazards, or through broadly advancing sustainable development in developing countries by meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. In fact, such efforts, which together could annually cost donor countries $150 billion according to UN Millennium Project and World Health Organization studies, should reduce global malaria, hunger, poverty, and lack of access to safe water and sanitation by 50 percent (each); reduce child and maternal mortality by at least 66 percent; provide universal primary education; and reverse growth in AIDS/HIV, and other major diseases. These numbers also indicate that no matter how important climate change might be in this century, for the next several decades it would be far more beneficial for human well-being, especially in developing countries, to deal with non-climate change related factors. Not only would either focused adaptation or adherence to the MDGs provide greater benefits at lesser costs through the foreseeable future than would any emission reduction scheme, they would help solve today's urgent problems sooner and more certainly. Equally important, they would also increase the ability to deal with tomorrow's problems, whether they are caused by climate change or other factors. None of these claims can be reasonably made on behalf of any mitigation scheme today. Accordingly, over the next few decades the focus of climate policy should be to: (a) broadly advance sustainable development, particularly in developing countries since that would generally enhance their adaptive capacity to cope with the many urgent problems they currently face, including many that are climate-sensitive, (b) specifically reduce vulnerabilities to climate-sensitive problems that are urgent today and might be exacerbated by future climate change, and (c) implement “no-regret” emission reduction measures, while (d) concurrently striving to expand the universe of no-regret options through research and development to increase the variety and cost-effectiveness of available mitigation options. Ancillary benefits associated with greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions Some GHG emission control options might provide substantial co-benefits by concurrently reducing problems not directly caused by climate change (e.g., air pollution or lack of sustained economic growth, especially in developing countries). However, in both these instances, the same, or greater, level of co-benefits can be obtained more economically by directly attacking the specific (non-climate change related) problems rather than indirectly through greenhouse gas control. On the other hand, a direct assault on the numerous climate-sensitive hurdles to sustainable development (e.g., hunger, malaria, and many natural disasters) would, as indicated, provide greater benefits more cost-effectively than would efforts to mitigate climate change.

Their proposition was interesting not least because it offered the germ of an explanation for the recent decline in unionism in some capitalist countries, notably the United States and Japan. However, the Kemp-Long analysis was conducted in terms of a simple model economy of the Solow-Swan type, with just one product, constant returns to scale and a constant savings propensity for capitalists. Since the appearance of their article, the possibility of long-run labour impotence has been reconsidered by several authors and it has emerged that an allembracing labour union might be able to do something for its members, even in the long run, if the production function is convex-concave, cf. Palokangas (1989), or if the union resorts to all-or-nothing offers, cf. Manning and Shea (1988), or if capitalists optimize over time, cf. Kemp and Long (198 9a, b).

However, labour economists typically assume that the wellbeing of workers also depends on the amount of leisure time available to them.

This study examined the impact on service users and other stakeholders of rapid response services for elderly and vulnerable residents living in social housing in north-east England. The housing provider has a rapid response team for residents as part of its organisational infrastructure. This includes a 24/7 emergency response service combined with a telecare service, funded by the local authority for vulnerable clients with complex needs and self-funded by others. The study utilised semi-structured qualitative interviews to collect data. Participants included service users, commissioners, service providers, adult social care and family carers. Thematic analysis was used to identify key issues. Service users reported feeling safer and more confident knowing someone would be there at times of need. Family carers reported improvements in their own health and well-being, as they no longer felt on call all the time. The number of requests for ambulances as a consequence of falls was reported to have reduced by the rapid response team. Vulnerable people with electronic monitoring/telecare support were able to remain in their own home for longer, reducing the need for residential funding by the local authority. The partnership between the housing association and the local authority resulted in a service able to respond to changing needs as well as identifying deterioration in residents' health status. In conclusion, the use of a combined rapid response and telecare service resulted in elderly people remaining independent in their homes for longer, which improved their reported quality of life and relieved stress on carers and pressures on other service providers.

The Panic of 1857 closed every bank in New York City, ruined thousands of businesses, and caused widespread unemployment among industrial workers. The Mormons in Utah Territory threatened rebellion when federal troops approached with a non-Mormon governor to replace Brigham Young. The Supreme Court outraged northern Republicans and abolitionists with the Dred Scott decision (""a breathtaking example of judicial activism""). And when a pro-slavery minority in Kansas Territory tried to foist a pro-slavery constitution on a large anti-slavery majority, President Buchanan reneged on a crucial commitment and supported the minority, a disastrous miscalculation which ultimately split the Democratic party in two. In America in 1857, eminent American historian Kenneth Stampp offers a sweeping narrative of this eventful year, covering all the major crises while providing readers with a vivid portrait of America at mid-century. Stampp gives us a fascinating account of the attempt by William Walker and his band of filibusters to conquer Nicaragua and make it a slave state, of crime and corruption, and of street riots by urban gangs such as New York's Dead Rabbits and Bowery Boys and Baltimore's Plug Uglies and Blood Tubs. But the focus continually returns to Kansas. He examines the outrageous political frauds perpetrated by proslavery Kansans, Buchanan's calamitous response and Stephen Douglas's break with the President (a rare event in American politics, a major party leader repudiating the president he helped elect), and the whirl of congressional votes and dramatic debates that led to a settlement humiliating to Buchanan, and devastating to the Democrats. 1857 marked a turning point, at which sectional conflict spun out of control and the country moved rapidly toward the final violent resolution in the Civil War.

103729,1990,social science quarterly,"specific deterrence, rational choice, and decision heuristics: applications in juvenile justice",specific deterrence rational choice and decision heuristics applications in juvenile justice,"INTRODUCTIONAccording to the traditional rational choice theory of criminal behavior, people choose to commit crimes in a rational manner.1 They weigh the costs and benefits and make informed decisions to maximize their utility.2 Under this framework, the state can deter crime through two main avenues: increasing the probability of detection and increasing the punishment if caught, both of which increase the total cost of committing a crime.3Recently, however, behavioral insights have begun to cast doubt on traditional rationality assumptions.4 Lab experiments and empirical studies using real-world data have shown that people exhibit bounded rationality.5 For example, individuals have limited cognitive capacities and use heuristics-mental shortcuts-to simplify complex decisions.6 A clear understanding about when and how these behavioral biases come into play can open up a new range of policy tools and help inform a more accurate model of criminal decisionmaking and deterrence.One specific behavioral anomaly that is now well recognized in the behavioral economics and psychology literature is ambiguity aversion.7 This phenomenon, which is distinct from risk aversion,8 occurs when an individual must make a cost-benefit analysis using incomplete information regarding the probabilities of future events, such as the likelihood of detection or probability of punishment. Sometimes, rather than relying on an unbiased estimate of the unknown probability, individuals will rely on a pessimistic estimation, overweighting the probability of a negative outcome due to their fear of the unknown. In other words, when there is uncertainty about the probabilities of various outcomes (ambiguity), people may assume that bad outcomes are more likely than they actually are.A few scholars have already suggested using this aversion to increase deterrence in the criminal context.9 They argue that if people are more likely to shy away from decisions that involve uncertain probabilities, making detection and punishment ambiguous-in other words, making the probability of detection and punishment more uncertain-can deter crime.10 However, this application is not as clear-cut as it might seem.11 Rather than finding ambiguity aversion in all circumstances, research has shown that individuals have a switching point at which they may become ambiguity-seeking under the right circumstances.12 Ambiguity-seeking behavior is the exact opposite of ambiguity-averse behavior. When ambiguity-seeking individuals make a cost-benefit analysis using incomplete information regarding the probabilities of future events, they rely on an optimistic estimation rather than an unbiased estimation, overweighting the probability of a positive outcome due to their preference for the unknown. This lack of uniform ambiguity attitudes implies that the imposition of ambiguity to increase deterrence will work only in some circumstances. In other circumstances, ambiguous punishment and detection may actually increase crime. When that is the case, policies that decrease ambiguity can better serve deterrence purposes.This Note is the first to apply these insights about ambiguity attitudes to the unique goals and structure of the juvenile justice system. As is the case in the adult criminal justice system, policies that increase the ambiguity of detection or decrease the ambiguity of punishment are promising means for deterring juvenile crime. Therefore, focusing on the circumstances under which juveniles are likely to be ambiguity-seeking, this Note argues that providing juvenile defendants with the right to counsel at intake proceedings, a practice currently employed only by some states,13 has the potential to reduce the ambiguity of punishment and deter juvenile crime. Part I presents the typical model of deterrence under traditional rationality assumptions and the impact of considering ambiguity attitudes in this context. Part II applies these behavioral insights to the specific context of the juvenile justice system, starting with an examination of the evidence of ambiguity-averse and ambiguity-seeking behavior among juveniles and progressing to an analysis of the ambiguity that exists in the juvenile justice system and how it can be manipulated to deter juvenile crime. … Collapse"

These advantages can be utilised by effective local leadership for developing 'niches of success' in the face of general economic stagnation.

103811,1990,urban studies,controlling and assisting privately rented housing,controlling and assisting privately rented housing,"In this article we examine the extent to which three minority groups were able to achieve selected neighborhood social and physical outcomes in the San Francisco mnetropolitan area. Ecological regressions were estimated to generate elasticities that measure the relative abilities of blacks, Hispanics, and Asians to convert education and income into desirable neighborhood environments. These regressions were interpreted in light of substantial differences between the three groups in levels of residential segregation. Results generally indicated a black disadvantage in the process of residential achievement, but it was not as dramatic as that found in earlier studies or as great as the levels of segregation would suggest. As in prior research, education was found to be the critical variable in explaining spatial differentiation and class stratification among blacks. In the United States, residences are allocated to persons and families through private housing markets. Since public housing comprises less than 2% of the nation's housing stock, and less than 1% of its housing starts (Adams 1987), virtually all households seeking a new residence enter the rental or sale market. Each household has a set of housing needs and desires based on its size, composition, life-cycle stage, and tastes; it also has a set of economic resources with which to achieve these desires, principally capital assets and income. Markets allocate households to specific residences through the mechanism of price; households purchase or rent the home that best suits their needs at the price they can afford (Berry & Rees 1969). According to neoclassic economic theory, the price of housing reflects the balance between aggregate demand and supply within local markets (Alonso 1964; Mills 1972). Researchers have pointed out, however, that housing is different from other commodities, and that these differences structure housing markets in distinct ways. First, residences are immobile; they are tied to a particular piece of land and cannot easily be consumed elsewhere (Logan & Molotch 1987). Second, they represent a very significant investment for most families, and for homeowners are the primary means of capital accumulation *Direct correspondence to the authors at the Population Research Center, University of Chicago, 1155 E. 60th Street, Chicago, IL 60637. i) The University of North Carolina Press Social Forces, September 1990, 69(1):15-32 This content downloaded from 157.55.39.104 on Mon, 20 Jun 2016 06:09:10 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms 16 / Social Forces 69:1, September 1990 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1986). Third, each residence is not only tied to a particular plot of land, it is also bound to a specific neighborhood (Massey et al. 1987) and, in turn, to a larger municipality (Logan 1978). Moreover, each geographic unit is associated with a social environment defined by the behaviors of residents and the service benefits provided by local government (Schneider & Logan 1982, 1985; Massey et al. 1987). Finally, houses, and the communities in which they are found, are more than mere commodities; they are also objects of powerful sentiments that influence judgments and condition decisions (Logan & Molotch 1987). In recognition of the fact that housing is immobile and linked to particular places, Charles Tiebout (1956) proposed a ""pure theory of local expenditures"" to account for the differentiated residential structure of cities. The theory rests on two key assumptions that households are free to move, and that places compete to attract them. Local governments offer different packages of tax costs, service benefits, and zoned environments from which home seekers choose. Over time, market competition produces a variety of service-tax-environment mixes and distributes households among them according to income, preferences, and wealth, yielding a residential structure differentiated by socioeconomic status, family life-cycle stage, race, and ethnicity. Although Tiebout's model recognizes some unique features of housing markets, it does not incorporate the fact that housing costs, and particularly home-ownership costs, reflect a substantial investment for families, or that homes, neighborhoods, and communities are the focus of strong emotional attachments. These traits give rise to what Stinchcombe (1965) calls ""communities of fate,"" where residents and institutions have large stakes not only in their own property, but in the property and characteristics of people in surrounding areas, making collective action highly likely. This propensity for collective action segments housing markets along social lines, so that individual choices are constrained by institutional practices and the collective behavior of others (Logan & Molotch 1987). The segmentation of housing markets, and the constraints it imposes on individual home seekers, are well illustrated by the case of U.S. blacks. The Tiebout model and its successors (Bish 1971; Peterson 1981) assume that households are free to move wherever their tastes and economic resources take them. Given this assumption, racial segregation is interpreted simply as the coincidental by-product of sorting based on income, wealth, and tastes (viz. Clark 1986). Considerable evidence, however, indicates that segregation does not stem from black preferences or low black-income levels. Public opinion polls show that blacks strongly endorse the principle of residential integration (Schuman et al. 1985) and express a clear preference for living in integrated neighborhoods, other things being equal (Farley et al. 1978). In spite of these tastes for integration, however, desegregation does not follow from the simple acquisition of socioeconomic resources sufficient to support spatial mobility. As education, income, and occupation rise, black-white segregation does not decline, but persists at a very high level (MIassey 1979, 1981; Denton & Massey 1988). Rather than reflecting tastes or socioeconomic status, black segregation appears to stem from constraints to black residential mobility imposed by the This content downloaded from 157.55.39.104 on Mon, 20 Jun 2016 06:09:10 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms Segregation and Neighborhood Quality / 17 collective behavior and institutional actions of whites. Studies of the real estate industry, for example, indicate that discrimination and prejudice are still widespread. Real estate agents systematically steer black home seekers away from white neighborhoods, and provide them less favorable treatment than whites (Molotch 1972; Pearce 1976; Wienk et al. 1979; Yinger 1986), actions which have been linked analytically to high levels of residential segregation (Galster 1986). At the same time, lending institutions have been found to finance a disproportionately small number of loans in black neighborhoods, even after objective social and economic factors are controlled (Taggart & Smith 1981; Pol et al. 1982; Leahy 1985). Moreover, in the few cases where blacks succeed in entering a white neighborhood, they are frequently met by organized white resistance and hostility (Hirsch 1983; Cass 1986; Bauman 1987), especially in working-class areas (Logan & Stearns 1981; Stearns & Logan 1986a); and if blacks succeed in establishing themselves, the neighborhood is quite likely to be avoided by subsequent white home seekers, resulting in eventual resegregation (Massey & Mullan 1984). Thus, the collective action of white residents and the institutional practices in the real estate and banking industries bifurcate urban housing markets along racial lines, fostering high levels of segregation despite a strong demand by blacks for integration. Some studies suggest that Hispanics face similar barriers, but to a lesser degree (Hakken 1979; James & Tynan 1986). The effect of a racially segmented housing market in creating and sustaining segregation is crucial to understanding the socioeconomic position of blacks in the United States. Barriers to spatial mobility are, in a very real way, barriers to social mobility. As Logan and Molotch (1987:49) point out, socioeconomic inequality among households and geographic inequality among places are not independent; the two systems of hierarchy reinforce one another: ""High status within the social hierarchy can bring access to the most desirable places ... and a guarantee of a rewarding future for whatever place one controls. At the same time a high status for one's geographical place means the availability of resources . . . that enhance life chances generally."" In a similar vein, Giddens (1980:107-12) argues that segregation is a core mechanism of class structuration, since it concentrates people of low status in space and ensures the maintenance of behaviors and orientations detrimental to success in the larger society. In this article we demonstrate how segregation structures the neighborhood environment achieved by three minority groups in one large urban area. We estimate the degree to which blacks, Hispanics, and Asians are able to convert socioeconomic achievements into selected neighborhood outcomes within the San Francisco-Oakland Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1980. The analysis proceeds in three phases. First, we establish the degree of segregation experienced by blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in the San Francisco SMSA. We then consider the extent to which the degree of segregation faced by each group affects its ability to convert status attainments into neighborhood social outcomes. Finally, we evaluate the degree to which each group is able to convert status attainments into different physical characteristics of the neighborhood environment.

Objective To examine whether participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is associated with a reduced likelihood of low-income older adults with diabetes (aged ≥65 years) needing to forgo medications because of cost. Design, Setting, and Participants This repeated cross-sectional, population-based study included 1302 seniors who participated in the National Health Interview Survey from 2013 through 2016. Individuals in the study were diagnosed with diabetes or borderline diabetes, were eligible to receive SNAP benefits, were prescribed medications, and incurred more than zero US dollars in out-of-pocket medical expenses in the past year. The data analysis was performed from October 2017 to April 2018. Exposures Self-reported participation in SNAP. Main Outcomes and Measures Cost-related medication nonadherence derived from responses to whether in the past year, older adults with diabetes delayed refilling a prescription, took less medication, and skipped medication doses because of cost. To estimate the association between participation in SNAP and cost-related medication nonadherence, we used 2-stage, regression-adjusted propensity score matching, conditional on sociodemographic and health and health care–related characteristics of individuals. Estimated propensity scores were used to create matched groups of participants in SNAP and eligible nonparticipants. After matching, a fully adjusted weighted model that included all covariates plus food security status was used to estimate the association between SNAP and cost-related medication nonadherence in the matched sample. Results The final analytic sample before matching included 1385 older adults (448 [32.3%] men, 769 [55.5%] non-Hispanic white, and 628 [45.3%] aged ≥75 years), with 503 of them participating in SNAP (36.3%) and 178 reporting cost-related medication nonadherence (12.9%) in the past year. After matching, 1302 older adults were retained (434 [33.3%] men, 716 [55.0%] non-Hispanic white, and 581 [44.6%] aged ≥75 years); treatment and comparison groups were similar for all characteristics. Participants in SNAP had a moderate decrease in cost-related medication nonadherence compared with eligible nonparticipants (5.3 percentage point reduction; 95% CI, 0.5-10.0 percentage point reduction; P = .03). Similar reductions were observed for subgroups that had prescription drug coverage (5.8 percentage point reduction; 95% CI, 0.6-11.0) and less than $500 in out-of-pocket medical costs in the previous year (6.4 percentage point reduction; 95% CI, 0.8-11.9), but not for older adults lacking prescription coverage or those with higher medical costs. Results remained robust to several sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance The findings suggest that participation in SNAP may help improve adherence to treatment regimens among older adults with diabetes. Connecting these individuals with SNAP may be a feasible strategy for improving health outcomes. Collapse"
103813,1990,urban studies,the tax treatment of housing:  economic issues and reform measures,the tax treatment of housing economic issues and reform measures,"Housing taxation expenditures are viewed by many as an important source of housing subsidies, although they have frequently emerged as taxation systems have evolved, rather than being designed specifically to aid housing consumption or production . The increasing severity of constraints on government budget deficits has elevated the issue of housing tax expenditures beyond that of mere academic curiosity . Some governments have sought to curb the growth of housing tax expenditures by reforming the tax treatment of housing . Is there a case for reform measures? Are there coherent and operational reform measures worthy of serious consideration? These questions raise a host of issues concerned with macro-economic performance, allocative efficiency and equity : macro-economic performance, because housing tax expenditures can erode the tax base, and thereby affect governments' budget deficits; allocative efficiency, because housing taxation expenditures will influence relative rates of return on housing assets and lead to changes in the economic behaviour of households and firms ; and equity, because housing taxation expenditures alter the relative tax burdens among individual taxpayers, and between owneroccupiers and tenants . In this paper each of these issues is addressed and the prospects for reform assessed in an international context . In doing so, I draw on the papers presented at the Joseph Rowntree International Conference on Housing Finance held in York in June 1989 . These provide relevant material on the existing array of housing tax expenditures employed by a representative sample of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Firstly, I discuss the relevance of the tax expenditure concept and briefly describe the housing taxation practices of these countries . Next, I explain why housing tax expenditures have attracted critical attention in recent years . This is followed by an examination of the attributes of tax expenditures as a means of supporting housing consumption and production, and the tenure-neutral reform proposals that are increasingly advocated by commentators on housing policy . Lastly, the recent reform measures introduced by OECD governments are explained and evaluated, and are followed by some concluding remarks . Collapse"

103816,1990,urban studies,housing finance and housing subsidies in canada,housing finance and housing subsidies in canada,"ing from the policy differences outlined earlier, four aspects of the organization and outputs of the U.S. welfare state stand out as unusual: the reliance on private provision; the degree of decentralized discretion; the persistent logic of deservingness; and the bias toward the elderly. Private provision. The American welfare state relies to an exceptional extent on the market, rather than the state, to provide social goods. In many countries, both public and private entities provide health care, occupational pensions, child care, housing, and higher education. But only in the United States is the private sector the predominant provider of so many of them. Such an extensive system of private social provision has not emerged organically; it has been engendered by an ideology of the superiority of markets solutions, and by an extensive (and expensive) set of direct and indirect public subsidies to promote the provision and consumption of private benefits and services (Stevens 1988; Howard 1997; Hacker 2002). Decentralized discretion. Even in nominally unitary states, subnational units may have important responsibilities for raising revenue, planning service delivery, and carrying out central mandates. Across welfare states, there is wide variety in the responsibilities delegated to subnational units, in the extent of redistribution of tax revenues across these units, and the extent of subnational variation in welfare outcomes. However, in most countries, standards for key welfare state attributes like population coverage, benefit packages, and eligibility criteria are agreed upon and enforceable by the national government. U.S. states and localities, on the other hand, have significant discretion in establishing the content of even those welfare policies that the federal government mandates and finances. Furthermore, the fact that so much of the U.S. federal government’s welfare activity comes in the form of low-visibility tax benefits and subsidies for private activity means that stateand local-level policies often appear to be where most of the welfare (p. 120) A Cross-National Perspective on the American Welfare State Page 10 of 22 PRINTED FROM OXFORD HANDBOOKS ONLINE (www.oxfordhandbooks.com).

Logic of deservingness. If welfare state decentralization varies in degrees across the advanced democracies, the persistent and often explicit motivation of U.S. welfare policy by a logic of deservingness is really a difference in kind. Much of the expansion of the welfare state in Europe and elsewhere in the post-WWII period was justified politically by a rhetoric of social inclusion and solidarity that resonated nearly as strongly with the Christian social tradition as with the social democratic one (Kersbergen 1995; Berman 2006). Christian democratic and social democratic actors may have privileged different aspects of social inclusion, but welfare policies across Western Europe, Canada, and the Antipodes reflected the principle of inclusion with elements of universal entitlement based on need and adequacy. America, on the other hand, has maintained a welfare state logic that instead prioritizes personal responsibility, help for the deserving only, and the principle of “less eligibility.” This feature is particularly noticeable in the field of social assistance, as “welfare” beneficiaries are particularly strongly stigmatized (see e.g. Soss 2000; Schneider and Ingram 1993). Even in other program areas—for example, Social Security, Medicaid, primary and secondary education, public housing, programs for the long-term unemployed—the U.S. welfare state has maintained eligibility criteria and benefit levels that are quite explicit in their intent of excluding the undeserving (the idle and shiftless, noncitizens, those without lengthy contribution records, those who live in poor areas, drug users, convicted felons, etc.) from social solidarity, rather than reintegrating or rehabilitating them.

Subscriber: University of Pennsylvania; date: 09 January 2018 The population deemed by many to be most deserving of access to social support in the United States is consistently the elderly (Cook 1992). In addition to this cultural support, seniors have a powerful and effective lobby group, the AARP, and an activated electorate (Campbell 2003). The combination of the elderly’s social and electoral desirability has merged with the particularistic political strategies of American politicians to make the United States one of the world’s most elderly oriented welfare states (Lynch 2006, Ozawa and Lee 2013). Older Americans’ access to social benefits has been consistently defended and expanded, whereas supports for workingaged adults and children are less emphasized, and less well funded. Aggregate spending data and analysis of individual income from social transfers show a distinct elderly orientation in the United States (Figure 7.3). Lynch (2006) further found a distinct skew toward the elderly in the United States in both tax expenditures for social purposes, and in health care spending. Pontusson reports that only “[t]‌ransfer spending that is not targeted on the elderly has a strong positive effect on redistribution among working-age households [...]” (Pontusson 2005, 158). As a result of this elderly orientation of social spending in the United States, poverty, child poverty, and income inequality among the nonelderly population in the United States are all well above the OECD average (see chapters on poverty and inequality in this volume). Unfortunately, the same processes that drive elderly oriented social policy also tend to produce stratification of pension benefits, with the paradoxical result that elderly oriented welfare states like the United States also tend to have higherthan-average poverty among the elderly (Lynch 2006, 182). 5 Comparative Welfare State Development Why does the U.S. welfare state not more closely resemble those of other rich countries? In ordinary public conversation, theories abound, including our Protestant heritage, our large and heterogeneous nation, the legacy of slavery, and the absence of a socialist party. Although each of these explanations contains a kernel of truth, none fully accounts for cross-national similarities and cross-national variation in welfare state institutions and outcomes. Comparative welfare state research has centered on the trinity of interests, ideas, and institutions to explain this variation.

Subscriber: University of Pennsylvania; date: 09 January 2018 Interests. Who was for and against the development of social policies in the United States? How do these coalitions compare to those in other countries? The configuration of interest groups in the United States did not augur well for the development of comprehensive, solidaristic welfare states. The strong sectoral split between the industrializing North and agricultural South, whose plantation economy relied on laborrepressive agriculture until well after emancipation, did nothing to encourage solidaristic social insurance programs, which more typically developed when smallholding landowners formed coalitions with nascent urban working-class movements (Baldwin 1990; Esping-Andersen 1990). America did have a politically assertive smallholding class, centered in the country’s Midwest and West, but despite their early joint success in establishing an income tax (Morgan and Prasad 2009), working-class partners for agrarian mobilization were notably weak. At the dawn of the American welfare state, unions were fragmented and lacking in the political “power resources” that have been hypothesized to drive welfare state expansion (Korpi 1983; Esping-Andersen 1985). Similarly, and in contrast to the strong social democratic parties in many parts of Europe, the United States has from the beginning lacked a labor-based party. As a result, “redgreen” alliances of the type that drove welfare state expansion elsewhere were impossible in the United States. Although there is much evidence for the argument that weak power resources on the left determined the relatively small size and private nature of the U.S. welfare state, it is not the whole story. Abundant comparative research has shown labor’s power alone has not built welfare states—employers have played an important role as well (Mares 2006; Swank and Martin 2001; Swenson 1989). The United States’ weak and fragmented organizations of employers, too, discouraged the formation of neocorporatis Collapse"

103820,1990,urban studies,housing finance in finland,housing finance in finland,"In Finland the private sector borrowing started to rise rapidly in conjunction with the liberalization of capital movements and deregulation of the domestic financial sector during the second half of the 1980s. The financial deregulation coincided with and amplified an economic boom marked by favourable income expectations, loose fiscal policy associated with improved terms of trade and anticipated reduction in income tax rates. All these factors contributed to the overheating of the Finnish economy that finally turned into a severe recession in the beginning of 1990s. The reaction of households to financial deregulation in Finland was similar to that in the other Nordic countries. As in Norway and Sweden, household indebtedness started to rise in the mid-1980s, after the abolishment of lending rate regulations and prior savings requirements for housing loans. Measured by the ratio of household debt to annual disposable income, household indebtedness peaked in 1990 at more than 80 per cent of annual disposable income. Since then, it has fallen slightly. Debt financing in the corporate sector started to increase rapidly in conjunction with the liberalization of capital movements, which enabled firms also in the domestic sector to raise loans in foreign currencies. During the 1980s debt financing grew most in the real estate business, construction and services. Despite increased borrowing, the debt with respect to equity of Finnish firms did not rise significantly until 1990–91, because a large part of the debt growth was matched by increases in corporate earnings and equity values during the late 1980s. Recession turned the situation for the worse as corporate earnings and the market value of assets plummeted. High indebtedness and overcapacity especially in the domestic sector will require several years of adjusting. Collapse"
103821,1990,urban studies,urban housing and financial markets:  some international comparisons,urban housing and financial markets some international comparisons,"The housing sector is the last major sector of the national economy for which analytical foundations for economic and financial policy evaluation have developed. However, the application of this analytical framework to international comparisons of housing policies or the evaluation of housing finance systems still lags considerably behind the strong foundations laid over the years for trade, finance or industry policy analyses. None the less, the era when improvisation and fragmented policy-making in housing and housing finance could be excused is well past. Today, there is a deep and expanding body of basic research and policy analysis that can be shared for the design of housing policies and housing finance institutions whether it is in the European Union or developing countries. Obviously, social and economic contexts as well as wealth levels differ greatly. Common analytical foundations can lead to very different prescriptions in countries where macroeconomic and financial policies, financial infrastructure, and urban laws policies and practices differ. In some countries, the institutions of the markets are so deep that we may no longer be fully aware of them. In others, they barely exist. Everywhere, the division of labour between public and private actions in both housing policy and housing finance is shifting. Like European countries, but at much lower levels of income and wealth, developing countries continue to seek growth with equity. However, those are countries where the majority of people are poor, cities are growing rapidly, public as well as private institutions are often weak and fiscal resources are severely constrained. In such environments, it seems to stand to reason that the financing of social housing should only be a subset of public concerns for the development of a safe and sound housing finance system that will be able to expand in step with urbanisation. The question addressed here is where the financing of social housing fits within the new world of housing finance. The search for alternative forms of housing finance for low-income groups cannot disregard overall trends affecting the financial sector and hope to be sustainable. It has become clear during the past two decades that there is no such thing as a homogeneous 'Third World' across which identical policies and instruments could be conveniently applied. This simplistic concept resulted from the Cold War, ignorance of distant foreign places and, in particular, of their specific human capital, laws, institutions and practices. The reality in housing finance, as well as in other areas of public policy, is that there are profound differences among the more than 180 advanced and developing countries that are now members of the World Bank. It is therefore important to think of housing finance as 'path-dependent' in the sense that any innovation will be shaped by past and current conditions. One can distinguish six broad types of housing finance systems. Their main features are briefly outlined here. In spite of such international diversity, the separation of subsidies from finance and the redesign of social housing finance programmes are everywhere a critical reference for the design and development of better housing finance systems.

This article examines the effects of such subsidies on output, prices, and welfare. It also briefly reviews the effects for varying price elasticities of supply and demand, for nontraded and fully traded goods, and for firms in which wages exceed their free market level. If the firm produces a nontraded good, the ""sickness"" of one firm that is subsidized to maintain production can spread to other firms that would be viable in the absence of the subsidies. The analysis shows that the exit constraints have the most detrimental effect when the elasticity of demand is low and supply elasticity is high, and when the government weighs the welfare of the firm's workers and consumers less than that of the general taxpayers and the firm owners. When labor costs are higher than their free market levels and output is thus less than the optimal levels, the subsidies could have an effect similar to that of an optimal production subsidy. In practice, bowever, this possibility is likely to be outweighed by associated rent-seeking costs and other distortions. Collapse"

It is now widely recognized, however, that many rural people can and will pay for improved water supplies, and that sustaining and extending services depends on mobilizing this willingness to pay. This article describes a study of willingness to pay for water in Brazil. The study shows that surveys of actual and hypothetical water-use practices can provide policy-relevant information on willingness to pay, which is shown to vary according to household socioeconomic characteristics and the characteristics of the existing and new supplies of water. In rural Brazil, tariffs for yard taps can be increased substantially before significant numbers of housebolds would choose not to connect to an improved system, whereas provision of free water at public taps can protect the poor without jeopardizing the financial viability of the scheme. Billions of people in developing countries face daily problems in obtaining water for drinking, cooking, bathing, and washing. More than 1,500 million people-30 percent of the world's population-are estimated to be without access to uncontaminated water; and an unknown but large proportion have to spend hours daily to collect water (Briscoe and de Ferranti 1988, Churchill 1987).

This article takes the analysis of import demand beyond the traditional income and price determinants to account for factors likely to be important to sub - Saharan African countries in the 1990s. First, the effect of demand on imports is reflected by the level of absorption rather than the less direct income variable. Second, because adjustment programs may cut government consumption and, through increases in interest rates, reduce investment, these components of absorption are also considered independently to assess their differential effect on imports. Third, import barriers are often set in dollar terms to limit the use of foreign exchange. Because reliable and complete data for import restrictions are not available, the ratio of exports to debt is included as an indicator of foreign exchange availability to reflect its effect on trade barriers and thus imports. The findings suggest that this more comprehensive assessment of import demand will be needed if the size and even direction of changes in import demand in response to policy reform is to be understood and anticipated.

This article examines how these measures affected the rural market. It begins with the question of how large the expansion of institutional credit has been and the extent to which it has dislodged the village and nonresident moneylenders. A detailed comparison of three major surveys of the Indian rural credit market suggests that in various guises, the moneylender is still a major source of loans. The article also examines the (weak) evidence on intermediation between the formal and informal sectors. A formal model of the interaction between the informal moneylender and institutional lender is constructed under a variety of assumptions about the exclusivity of loan contracts and the competitive structure of the informal sector. The conclusions are drawn together in the form of five proposals for public policy. Collapse"

While policy analysts often look to policy successes and failures outside their borders to draw valuable lessons and insights, cultural, economic, political, and institutional conditions vary from country to country and strongly affect how policy analysis is ultimately used. By combining a conceptual discussion of policy making with an examination of seven specific policy areas, Jessica Adolino and Charles Blake show how politics-in the realm of the environment, education, taxation, economics, immigration, health care, and social welfare-shapes policy choices. The second edition of Comparing Public Policies has been revised and updated to reflect the most recent political and policy developments. This new edition expands coverage of the internationalization of domestic policy making by including a European Union case study in each issue area, along with further discussion of the role of international interest groups in the policy process. The seven policy chapters have been revised and updated to examine current issues in the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and the European Union, such as: - the heightened calls for immigration policy reform - the return to higher budget deficits in several countries - the efforts to lower tax rates in countries with falling expenditures and in countries with rising spending levels - the often unsuccessful attempts to control increasing health care costs in countries with aging populations - the spirited debate over the future role of the welfare state in an increasingly globalized economy - the, at times, divergent education reform debates regarding the role of assessment and calls for decentralization - the uneven environmental performance in the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions Chapters include analyses of crossnational trends-past and present-and a final chapter reexamines the internationalization of public policy in industrialized countries. Useful pedagogical features have been incorporated throughout the text, including ""In Depth"" boxes that offer detailed discussion of the political process or analytical techniques, and ""Country At-a-Glance"" boxes that provide quick reference to political institutions.

Experience with government-managed irrigation development in Kenya is discussed, focusing in particular on the Bura Irrigation Settlement Project and on small-scale irrigation in Turkana. It is argued that the performance of both large and small schemes has been poor, and it is suggested that the scale of scheme operation is of less importance in determining the success of development than is the extent to which government irrigation is bureaucratically controlled. Most schemes have been neither initiated nor controlled by farmers. It is bureaucratic management, rather than scale itself, which seems to be the key cause of poor performance in Kenyan irrigation. Therefore, small is by no means always beautiful in the context of irrigation, and enthusiasm for small-scale irrigation as a target of development funding needs to be tempered with caution. The most important feature of small-scale irrigation is its informal nature. The implications of the poor performance of bureaucratically-controlled irrigation are discussed in the context of widespread and growing interest in small-scale approaches to African irrigation.

One sample covers those SMEs transferring technology to the largest or more active Third World countries; the other concerns Canadian SMEs transferring technology to industrialized market economies. Both samples are representative of their respective populations. The paper tests the usefulness of current theories of multinational firms (based on the study of large corporations), and reviews the appropriate technology debate. It also characterizes the manufacturing SMEs that are currently selling technology in the global market. It confirms much of the received theory of multinational corporations. The SMEs studied are very active in research and development, combine technology transfer and foreign direct investment whenever possible, and occupy large portions of the domestic (and often international) market. Their technology (centered on niches) is only complementary to that of large MNCs, not an alternative. This finding is contrary to some aspects of appropriate technology theories. Collapse"

Brief descriptions of other IT projects and partnerships in the region will be provided. Overview of the Ibero-American Science & Technology Education Consortium (ISTEC) ISTEC is a non-profit organization comprised of educational, research, and industrial institutions throughout the Americas and the Iberian Peninsula. The Consortium was established in September 1990, to foster scientific, engineering, and technology education, joint international research and development efforts among its members, and to provide a cost-effective vehicle for the application of technology. The idea evolved out of a needs-analysis study conducted by the University of New Mexico Electrical and Computer Engineering Department in Latin America. This study revealed the following obstacles to science and technology information (S&T) sharing and information technology (IT) developments in the region: • Lack of current information for planning and developing technology • Lack of expertise in the use of information • Lack of international cooperation in developing the critical mass needed for projects and joint efforts • Lack of interaction (lack of confidence and sometimes lack of information) between universities and industries This situation has been improving steadily but at the time it was clear that a unifying organization was needed to bring S&T workers together across borders; national, social and economic. With start-up funding from the State of New Mexico and selected IT companies, especially Nortel and Motorola, the ISTEC board created four initiatives to address the above obstacles: 1. The ACE Initiative champions continuing engineering and computer sciences education projects. The most important goals are to upgrade human resources and curriculum development through on-site training, distance learning, and non-traditional exchange programs. This involves not only on-site training, but web-based education, video courses, satellite delivery, and ""sandwich"" graduate programs. The latter brings graduate students from Ibero-America together with experts from ISTEC member organizations to ensure excellence. Examples of outcomes so far include: 6 satellite courses to 250 institutions with ATEI (an Iberian continuing education television society), numerous short courses for Motorola, and over 200 scientists trained in DIP with support from the Organization of American States (OAS). Over 30,000 ftp grabs of the web-based DIP course have been documented. ""Sandwich"" programs have been conducted with PhD students in Spain, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Mexico. These programs bring doctoral students from Latin America to the University of New Mexico to obtain additional experience in areas not offered at their own organizations, or alternately, professors from selected US universities spend a month on site at a Latin American university and works intensively with a cluster of students from the region. 2. The Research and Development (R&D) Initiative focusses on the development and enhancement of laboratory infrastructure at member organizations. The major goal is the design and installation of modular, flexible, and expandable laboratory facilities for education, training, and R&D with links to the productive/private sector. Successful implementations include the deployment of Motorola microprocessors (680XX), microcontrollers (68HC11) and DSPs (56XXX, 96000) as well as equipment, software and expertise from companies such as Nortel Networks, Fluke, and VeriBest. To date 29 Motorola facilities are in place with planned expansion to 58. Approximately 20,000 users have been trained since 1991. There are 9 facilities with laboratory equipment from Nortel Networks, 2 with Fluke and 1 with VeriBest. The latter are planning to expand to 12 facilities. 3. The Los Libertadores Initiative champions networks of excellence in the region. The main goal is to network such Centers of Excellence equipped with the latest telecommunications and computer technology to provide real-time access to a worldwide system of expertise and knowledge. This requires partnerships among industries and governments to create a robust Ibero-American academic and R&D Internet backbone. Towards this goal technical assistance in telecommunications and S&T legislation has been provided to Ecuador and Bolivia. Participation in regional policy conferences such as the IADB’s Informatics 2000 Conference is a part of ISTEC’s strategy. We also assist national, regional and international organizations such as the OAS and UNESCO to develop IT&T strategies for Ibero-America, but in particular for Latin America. 4. The Library Linkages Initiative (LibLINK) is ISTEC’s information sharing, knowledge management, and connectivity project. The next section will focus on this initiative and its efforts in developing digital library projects in Latin America. Suffice to say that the digital libraries component of LibLINK is currently the centerpiece of all the initiatives as it brings people and projects together through sharing information freely and rapidly. Overview of the Library Linkages (LibLINK) project of ISTEC The major goal of LibLINK is to design and implement innovative, international Science and Technology (S&T) information sharing and management services. Thus the Internet and connectivity is of primary importance. The seed funding for LibLINK was provided by Nortel Networks and it is currently supported by membership dues. The annual compound growth rate of the Rapid Document Delivery (RDD) project was around 200% between 1995 and 1999. Since 2000 this is evening out due to successful regional sharing of local resources. Over 27 libraries in 19 countries are connected in real-time and documents are provided using the Ariel® software from the Research Libraries Group. The Centennial Science & Engineering Library (CSEL) at the University of New Mexico, USA, is the headquarters for this initiative and provides document delivery resources free from local collections. Expanded services are also provided at cost from the Canada Institute for Science and Technology Information (CISTI). The RDD project, although the most popular service is a foundation for the more important digital library initiatives which were started in 1998. The projects within LibLINK can be categorized as follows: • Connecting libraries for Information Transfer. This is accomplished through opening Science and Technology library collections especially Latin American collections for scholars through regional networks created to compliment the LibLINK document delivery services. Currently these include LigDoc in Brazil, PrEBi in Argentina, REBIDIMEX in Mexico, and most recently, cooperative groups of libraries in Colombia and Venezuela. • Training librarians and researchers in the efficient and cost-effective search and retrieval of information, document delivery software and processes, and digital library concepts. LibLINK volunteers plan and carry out workshops and miniconferences to facilitate the above. Funding generally come from successful grants from organizations such as the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and other national science councils such as CONACyT in Mexico, and regional organizations such as the Organization of American States (OAS) and UNESCO. • Continually expanding services to more S&T libraries, especially in Latin American countries. The intention is to also expand to other library types (especially Health Sciences) and services. • Developing software for information sharing. One of our member organizations, the University of Vigo in Spain, is developing a document sharing and collaborative workspace technology, called RANDEX. All such developments are tested by members and provided free to members once proven useful. • Developing “push and search” engines for information delivery in conjunction with the ISTEC Portal. • Working with the Networked Dissertation/Thesis Library (NDTL) initiative at Virginia Tech to expand the concept in Ibero-America. • Providing the main interaction method for the ACE and R&D initiatives and participation in the development of a database on S&T people, projects, policies, interests, publications, and opportunities in Latin America. • Advancing and piloting new types of scholarly communication. An electronic journal in computer engineering was established at the Universidad National de la Plata (Argentina) to develop experience in this area. We are actively supporting new publishing efforts such as the NDTL mentioned above and the Open Archives initiative. • Writing grants to further our goals. Grants have been written to IDB, UNESCO, World Bank, NSF and various science councils in the region, OAS, UNESCO, and to other national organizations and industrial partners. To accomplish the above, the LibLink program has developed four sub-initiatives. These are listed below with their current major goals. Initiative 1: Rapid Electronic Document Delivery and general services Connect more libraries and collections in the region Expand services to related multidisciplinary subject areas, e.g. Health care Continued creation, improvement, and/or expansion of regional LibLink Offices (LigDoc, PrEBi, Red de Colombia, REBIDIMEX, etc.) Initiative 2: Consortial Electronic Content Negotiate with vendors for E-journal packages Regional database contracts for citation as well as full-t Collapse"

This Note examines the current state of the law relating to the presidential impoundment of funds and will argue that Congress should resist proposals to expand presidential impoundment powers. Instead, Congress should create additional tools to insure that the President does not unconstitutionally impound funds in the future. Professor Kate Stith argues that there are two governing principles relating to the federal budget: (1) the Principle of the Public Fisc, which ""assert[s] that all monies received from whatever source by any part of the government are public funds""3 and (2) the Principle of Appropriations Control, which ""prohibit[s] expenditure of any public money without legislative authorization.""4 There is also arguably a third principle, which is the inverse of the Principle of Appropriations Control.

Courts traditionally have not awarded punitive damages ""for a breach of contract unless the conduct constituting the breach is also a tort for which punitive damages are recoverable.""2 Courts also will not grant specific performance ""if damages would be adequate to protect the expectation interest of the injured party,"" nor will courts enforce contracts that accord promisees a right to specific relief.3 These three rules share the goal of limiting a promisee's recovery to his lost expectation. The liquidated damage rule prevents the promisee from contracting for a supracompensatory remedy, and the punitive damage rule prevents courts from awarding such a remedy. The specific performance rule achieves the law's goal indirectly. A promisee who has a right to specific performance can compel the promisor to perform even when the promisor's loss from performance would exceed the promisee's gain. A promisor can purchase her freedom, but sophisticated promisees sometimes will demand more than their expectation as the price. Permitting specific performance only when damages could not protect the expectation interest limits the ability of promisees to obtain supracompensatory payments by threatening to seek specific relief. The ban on ""specific performance clauses"" prevents a promisee from obtaining by contract he power that the general specific performance rule aims to abolish. Collapse"

Croson Co.,' the Supreme Court once again struggled with the constitutionality of affirmative action. The struggle revolves around the tension inherent in the Fourteenth Amendment, which mandates the elimination of discrimination while simultaneously compelling the equal protection of all people. This tension is apparent where the elimination of discrimination requires that particular groups be treated disparately. Where the effects of discrimination continue to disadvantage a group even after the explicit discriminatory practice has been prohibited, preferential treatment may be necessary to remedy the continued discriminatory impact. In order to restore a disadvantaged minority to real equality, therefore, a government may have to employ a program that bestows remedial benefits on the basis of race. Absent such means, the group may continue to suffer the effects of past discrimination perpetuated by the application of facially neutral laws to the status quo. Unfortunately, the Croson decision does little to resolve the conflicting mandates of the Fourteenth Amendment.' If anything, the decision perpetuates the tension. The broad directives of the decision recognize the continued need to redress past specific discrimination, implying that the Fourteenth Amendment Collapse"

103936,1990,yale law journal,immigration law after a century of plenary power: phantom constitutional norms and statutory interpretation,immigration law after a century of plenary power phantom constitutional norms and statutory interpretation,"With its plenary power doctrine, the Supreme Court erred by rejecting the universal in favor of the particular. Liberal immigration theorists, on the other hand, make the opposite error by rejecting the particular in favor of the universal. Drawing on classic international law publicists and the Catholic philosophical tradition, this essay argues that the two concepts— the state’s greater duty toward its own citizens (the particular) and equal dignity and worth of all human beings (the universal)—go hand in hand: complementing each other and giving the state a qualified right to limit immigration along with a qualified duty to admit vulnerable emigres. Footnote 1 of Justice Scalia’s opinion in Arizona v. United States serves as my point of departure. Scalia says: Many of the 17th-, 18th-, and 19th-century commentators maintained that states should exclude foreigners only for good reason. Pufendorf, for example, maintained that states are generally expected to grant “permanent settlement to strangers who have been driven from their former home,” though acknowledging that, when faced with the prospect of mass immigration, “every state may decide after its own custom what privilege should be granted in such a situation.” Scalia mentions what he characterizes as “prudential limitations” on the power to exclude aliens in the context of his argument that Arizona, like the United States, has a right inherent in sovereignty to exclude aliens from its territory “subject only to those limitations expressed in the Constitution or constitutionally imposed by Congress.” * Gene and Elaine Edwards Chair in Law, University of Oklahoma College of Law. I would like to thank the Oklahoma Law Review for hosting this symposium and my fellow panelists for their insightful comments and engaging dialogue. 1. Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2511 (2012) (emphasis added) (quoting 2 SAMUEL PUFENDORF, OF THE LAW OF NATURE AND NATIONS bk. III, ch. III, § 10, at 366 (C.H. Oldfather & W.A. Oldfather trans., 1934) (1688)) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). 2. Id. 3. Id. 120 OKLAHOMA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 68:119 I won’t focus on the merits of Scalia’s argument that individual states within the United States retain sovereign powers to exclude. My interest lies, instead, in his recognition that historically the sovereign power over immigration was limited—not plenary. This narrative, although presented in threadbare fashion in the footnote of a dissenting opinion, offers a corrective to 125 years of misguided sovereign absolutism. The dominant narrative—the one that is the subject of this symposium— is succinctly summed up by the Supreme Court in the 1972 case of Kleindienst v. Mandel: In accord with ancient principles of the international law of nation-states, the Court in The Chinese Exclusion Case [Chae Chan Ping] held broadly . . . that the power to exclude aliens is “inherent in sovereignty, necessary for maintaining normal international relations and defending the country against foreign encroachments and dangers-a power to be exercised exclusively by the political branches of government . . . .” 4. David Martin’s symposium contribution provides an implicit reply. See David A. Martin, Why Immigration’s Plenary Power Doctrine Endures, 68 OKLA. L. REV. 29, 31 (2015) (Chae Chan Ping answered “a federalism question,” establishing “that the federal government in fact does possess the authority to regulate migration”). 5. 408 U.S. 753, 765 (1972) (citations omitted). In his contribution to this symposium, Kevin Johnson makes a forceful argument that, as a legal matter, the dominant narrative is muzzled by statutory and regulatory interpretation, lessening the harshness of plenary power’s full potential. See Kevin R. Johnson, Immigration in the Supreme Court, 2009-13: A New Era of Immigration Law Unexceptionalism, 68 OKLA. L. REV. 57, 63-64 (2015) (“[T]he Court has, to a large extent, continued to bring U.S. immigration law into the jurisprudential mainstream.”); see also Martin, supra note 4, at 32 (“The litigation picture is not so bleak as often portrayed. Subconstitutional litigation is plentiful, with a significant success rate . . . .”); Hiroshi Motomura, Immigration Law After a Century of Plenary Power: Phantom Constitutional Norms and Statutory Interpretation, 100 YALE L. J. 545, 560 (1990) (“The principal decisions that have contributed to this expansion of judicial review in immigration cases have not been decisions of constitutional immigration law. Instead, they reached results favorable to aliens by interpreting statutes, regulations, or other forms of subconstitutional immigration law.”). My interest lies in the political/cultural effect of this narrative rather than its strictly legal effect. Margaret Taylor and Kit Johnson’s contribution to the symposium, describing the conditions of confinement at Artesia, suggests that the dominant narrative has much purchasing power in shaping the cultural/political debate. Margaret H. Taylor & Kit Johnson, “Vast Hordes . . . Crowding in Upon Us”: The Executive Branch’s Response to Mass Migration and the Legacy of Chae Chan Ping, 68 OKLA. L. REV. 185, 186 (2015) (moving beyond formal legal doctrine to assess the plenary power doctrine’s influence on “the Executive Branch’s policy response to mass migration”). 2015] SCALIA’S REPLY TO 125 YEARS OF PLENARY POWER 121 Since Chae Chan Ping, “[t]he Court without exception has sustained Congress' plenary power” over immigration. Since that time, this misinterpretation of the “ancient principles of international law of the nation-states” has led the Court to “repeatedly emphasize[] that ‘over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over’ the admission of aliens.” The plenary power doctrine was born in 1889 in the Chinese Exclusion Case, Chae Chan Ping v. United States. In concluding that a long-term United States resident, Chae Chan Ping, was excludable from the United States on his return home after visiting China, the Court, quoting Chief Justice Marshall in Schooner Exchange v. McFadden, said: The jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute. It is susceptible of no limitation not imposed by itself. Any restriction upon it, deriving validity from an external source, would imply a diminution of its sovereignty to the extent of the restriction, and an investment of that sovereignty to the same extent in that power which could impose such restriction. The Court, in Chae Chan Ping, failed to quote or explore the Schooner Court’s limitation of this supposedly “exclusive and absolute” right—“all sovereigns have consented to a relaxation in practice, in cases under certain peculiar circumstances, of that absolute and complete jurisdiction within their respective territories which sovereignty confers. This consent may, in 6. Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 765 (1972). 7. Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 797 (1977) (quoting Oceanic Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, 214 U.S. 320, 339 (1909)). 8. Chae Chan Ping v. United States, 130 U.S. 581 (1889). 9. 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 116, 136 (1812). 10. Chae Chan Ping, 130 U.S. at 604 (emphasis added). My focus is on the Supreme Court’s initial error in concluding that nation-states have an absolute right to exclude under international law. There are, however, at least two other bases for limiting the sovereign power to exclude: one that would have been available to the Court in 1889 and the other of more recent origin. First, the Court did not analyze whether the Constitution itself placed internal as opposed to external restraints on the ability to exclude. For example, does the Constitution’s equal protection norm forbid exclusion based upon race? See Michael Scaperlanda, Polishing the Tarnished Golden Door, 1993 WIS. L. REV. 965, 976-77. Second, more recent cases, including Kleindienst v. Mandel, fail to address the rights revolution in international law over the past several decades, which limits the sovereignty of nation-states in ways that might be relevant to immigration. See id. at 1009-15. 122 OKLAHOMA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 68:119 some instances, be tested by common usage, and by common opinion, growing out of that usage.” Instead, the Chae Chan Ping Court continued: The power of exclusion of foreigners being an incident of sovereignty belonging to the government of the United States as a part of those sovereign powers delegated by the constitution, the right to its exercise at any time when, in the judgment of the government, the interests of the country require it, cannot be granted away or restrained on behalf of any one.

As chairman of the California Task Force for the Seriously Mentally I1l, he outlines the planning process by which a bill was drafted that ultimately may revamp the entire mental health system. Passed by the California legislature and signed into law by the governor, an integrated service system conceived by the determined father of a mentally ill person will now be tested. I am tempted to write, from a family's perspective, about supported work as therapy for persons afflicted with schizophrenia. An idea whose time keeps coming around, work offers a positive alternative to mindless empty days filled with cigarettes, coffee, and TV. It is clear to me that the mentally ill, just as much as any of us, need success and satisfaction that comes only from meeting real and meaningful challenges. I have also been tempted to use this space to question why so few support programs for the mentally ill deal with the assets of the persons they serve, the abilities that are still intact. Why do they drone on mercilessly, focused on symptoms and deficits, invariably arriving at outcomes of little consequence for vulnerable individuals whose brains are terrorized and disorganized by profound disease? But instead of that, I intend to use this communication opportunity to offer a few hard-to-handle observations in the hope that you will find yourself challenging what I say or adding some of your own ideas. It has been 10 years since my son David called me from Harvard University, where he was on the president's list as an outstanding scholar, and said I can handle it, Dad. I don't want you to worry. I've checked into the psychiatric clinic, and they've given me some medicine. It's the strangest thing. I hear voices, hundreds of them, telling me that everyone wants me dead. It's like all the radios of the world blaring all the stations at once, and it doesn't stop. It jams my brain. God, I hope they can help me. I remember those words as clearly as if it were yesterday. Scared, yet confident, needful yet capable, the oldest of my children had embarked on a voyage into what is arguably the most terrifying and painful realm of human experience--the uncharted, unpredictable depths ofbiological brain disease, schizophrenia. How quickly Harvard, perhaps the best and certainly the most self-congratulatory institution of higher learning in our country, wanted him out of there. Knowing what I now know about the disease that afflicts David, I can almost forgive Harvard their haste in abandoning this young man whom they had so aggressively courted because his grade point average and Scholastic Achievement Test scores were nearly perfect and his self-assured entrance essay showed such promise. I won't burden you with a litany of complaints about doctors and medications, hospitals and clinics, treatment programs, residences, governmental bureaucracies, and the like. The insensitive, often abusive behavior of some who provide ""service"" is thankfully balanced by the dedicated, resourceful, and resilient behavior of others. You learn how to be grateful for the good moments and the caring professionals. I found, after a couple of years in this unwanted and demanding experience, that I was so angry and so depleted emotionally and financially that I had to make a conscious change in my own behavior in order that I might survive. As I attempted to locate help for my son, I found, instead of a mental health system, a bewildering, Kafkaesque maze of difficult-to-access programs for which nobody had continuing responsibility or sufficient authority and where standards of quality were nonexistent. Because I work in the media as an observer of the human condition and a storyteller, I went public with my feelings about all of the issues surrounding serious mental illness and especially about the experience of living with my ill son and searching for appropriate care. My wife had insisted that our ill son remain at home to be nurtured in the bosom of the family. Instinctively, she refused to cast out her ill son, to abandon a child in need to "" them"" out there in a less-than-caring world that gave little evidence of concern for his best interests. I admired that loving grit and determination but disagreed totally. Somehow, somewhere, there had to be people and programs and residences capable of offering David more of what he now needed than we in our ignorance could provide. His illness and the behaviors it evoked dumbfounded and frightened us. And, of course, there were our two younger children, a daughter and a son, both in high school, who were suffering psychologically and physically from our ill son's unpredictable antics. Even when he was out of the home during an acute hospitalization, or when he had run off somewhere in a fit November 1990 • American Psychologist Copyright 1990 by the American Psyeholosical Association, Inc. 0003-066X/90/$00.75 Vol. 45, No. 11, 1245-1248 1245 of schizophrenic wanderlust and was living by his wits in the streets of God-knows-where, it was always David's needs and ""poor David's condition"" that seemed to dominate everything and hover everywhere. But the psychiatrists, psychologists, and day-treatment programs we turned to offered processes that had very little relevance to his raging illness and our confusing circumstance--at least in our judgment. We sensed that something was wrong; something was missing. At first, naturally, we suspected our own judgment. We had no prior experience to fall back on, so we listened attentively to professional talk about structure and lowering of expectations and about how to communicate with an ill person who was experiencing terrifying and distorted perceptions. We were game, we were willing to try almost everything. What we found was a paucity of ideas that worked. A lot of mystification of process shrouded in polysyllabic argot--appropriately annotated and attributed to source, of course--but when decoded there was a scant yield of a few tangible suggestions about what we might do to make life more bearable for him and, frankly, for the rest of us, especially if David were to continue living in the family home. Our home, incidentally, was rapidly becoming an institution in which David wasn't getting better and we were all getting worse. Meanwhile, outside of our home, my father was diagnosed as having the most virulent form of leukemia, with a prognosis of six months to live. My mother's cardiologist confided that her heart disease, complicated by diabetes and stressed by my father's sudden grave illness, could snuff out her life at any time. My brother's cocaine abuse, which had destroyed his very successful fashion photography career, was about to take him from the scene. And my mother-in-law was on the verge of the first of three devastating strokes that would leave her bedridden, a veritable vegetable, despite miraculously successful brain surgery. As the family decision maker, I found myself coming to grips with how American medicine delivers benefits to those in need, insured, and capable of paying for the best that can be purchased. It was a soap opera wrapped in a nightmare. By far the worst of circumstances were to be found in the bizarre, nonsystematic way in which our society pretends to support the needs of the seriously mentally ill. In political rhetoric lawmakers give the impression of attention and concern; our bureaucracies display the illusion of care provided. And, as a people, we seem to accept this outrage as if it were the way things had to be. Hundreds of families have thought that perhaps it was their ill family member's unique symptoms that made the existing housing and the day treatment and the medication less than effective, less than adequate. Dan E. Weisburd is President of the California Alliance for the Mentally I11 (CAMI), the largest affiliate of the National AMI. He publishes and edits The Journal of the California Alliance for the Mentally I11, which is now in its second year of publication. Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Dan E. Weisburd, 10260 Moorpark Street, Toluca Lake, CA 91602. What came as no small surprise was to find parallel areas of neglect in the other profound illnesses that beset my various family members. Housing was one such area. Go into expensive acute hospital care and almost anything you could ask for is available, paid for in large measure by insurance, or out of pocket if you can afford it. But, try to maintain a home for a stroke victim; a heart patient; or a person gravely ill with leukemia, a drug problem, or a brain disease like schizophrenia, and see what you come up against. Far lower cost? Definitely true. But who will pay for the ""professional care"" needed? The state? No. The federal government? No. The private insurer? No way. Not in most cases. Premium costs would be staggering. The vice president of Blue Cross told me that on the ""Today"" show. So, without a reasonable flow of capital for home care, no trained labor force develops; none exists. Move your seriously ill family member to a community residence, is what society tells you.

He argued that the overvalued U.S. dollar reduced export demand and the domestic price of U.S. grains. Since then, much of the work on estimating the impact of exchange rate changes on agriculture has implicitly assumed that inputs to the agricultural sector come from the nontraded sector.' We argue this assumption can result in an error in the estimation of the effects of exchange rates. In an examination of the passthrough of changes in the $US/CDN exchange rate, we find the data from 1975 to 1989 are consistent with the hypothesis of a complete passthrough of exchange rates for many important variable inputs to Canadian agricultural production. This analysis indicates that, while exchange rates may have had significant impacts on the return to fixed factors and farm income, they have had little effect on grain production. In the case of livestock feeding in Canada, exchange rate devaluations may actually reduce production and reduce the return to fixed factors because inputs (especially grain) are more tradeable than outputs. Finally, we examine the potential welfare impact on nontradeables (such as land) from changes in the exchange rate. Theoretical Model Collapse"

104009,1990,american journal of agricultural economics,imperfect information and the theory of government intervention in farm credit markets,imperfect information and the theory of government intervention in farm credit markets,"This paper describes some possible economic motivations for government intervention in farm credit markets. These motivations are made possible by explicit departures from the perfect information and complete market assumptions that underlie both the neoclassical competitive paradigm and the fundamental theorems of welfare economics. To be more precise, the analysis focuses on three types of asymmetric information between farmers and prospective outside investors, both of whom are assumed to be risk neutral. Arguably, the three informational asymmetries examined here represent natural departures from ""perfect markets"" in that, unlike the unencumbered neoclassical model, each elicits farmers' optimal use of debt contracts (rather than equity instruments or other contractual forms) to raise investment capital. Despite their consistency with observed contractual choices, all three of the models analyzed below yield free-market equilibria that diverge from first best/perfect information outcomes. Given the inefficiency of these market equilibria, the key question raised and discussed here is: Can government improve upon the derived competitive outcomes and, if so, how? Despite the enormity of the credit rationing literature, only a few extant studies address this question in models that are consistent with debt contracts. Among them are DeMeza and Webb (1987, 1988, 1989) and Innes (1988), which focus on the third type of informational asymmetry considered below. The other two information structures posited in this paper have been studied in several analyses of credit markets, but with attention focused on positive attributes of the unfettered competitive equilibrium rather than on prospective implications for welfare-enhancing government intervention. In what follows, th s literature is surveyed and, for the first two information structures, some new policy results a e presented.

Noodle quality attributes measured for each formulation flour in the 10.0-11.5% protein range, using 1.4-1.7% sodium chloride combination were color, pH, firmness, mold growth, and odor. Sodium and 0.7-1.2% sodium carbonate. carbonate affected all properties of partially cooked noodles; protein level Chinese wet noodles, also known as ""boiled noodles"" or ""Hokkien mee"" are possibly the most popular kind of noodles in Southeast Asia (Moss 1971). Essentially, this kind of noodle is obtained by partially cooking raw noodles for a short period of time (1-2 min) resulting in a fine core of dough in the center, surrounded by cooked or gelatinized dough. The noodles are made available to the consumer in this partially cooked form and are then reboiled prior to consumption. Noodle quality has two distinct aspects: appearance and eating quality. Color and brightness are a part of the appearance aspect. Color preference varies with the region, although most consumers prefer a clear pale yellow product free from specks and discoloration. A certain degree of translucency and glossiness adds to product appeal. Chinese wet noodles are unique with regard to their eating quality requirements: a firm ""al dente"" product is considered desirable. Currently there is a need for scientific information to show how wheat flour and other components can best be utilized in the production of Oriental types of noodles. Chinese wet noodles were selected for this study because of their simple formulation and relative popularity. The purpose of this study was to find an optimum formulation for Chinese wet noodles. This involved a detailed analysis of selected Southeast Asian noodle flours and the effect of selected ingredients on noodle quality. A response surface study was done using a fractional factorial design consisting of three variables at three levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS Flour Samples of flour typically used for wet noodle manufacture in Southeast Asia were received from Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore. No speculation is made regarding the origin of the wheats or their class. The samples were tested (data not shown) for proximate composition and rheological performance.

With a maltose content of 19 mg/ 10 g of flour, brand A was brighter and had a higher amylograph peak viscosity (3,310 BU) than brand B (2,980 BU) and was free from sprout damage (falling number 375). Brand B was known to have fungal amylase supplementation (falling number 250) and a maltose content of 23 mg/ 10 g flour. Starch damage contents were low for both brands and the flours showed no oxidizing agents present as indicated by the extensigraph. Flour brand A was known to be a raw material in demand for making Chinese wet noodles in Southeast Asia. Equal parts of flour brands A and B were blended together to give a third flour with an intermediate protein level for the response surface study designed to determine optimum Chinese wet noodle formulation. Flours A and B were obtained from a commercial flour mill in Malaysia. Chemicals Food grade sodium chloride and sodium carbonate (Fisher Scientific Co., Minneapolis, MN) were used. Experimental Design A response surface design described by Cochran and Cox (1971) was used to study the relative contribution of a variable to noodle quality and to determine the optimum noodle formulation. Following preliminary trials, three independent variables were selected: flour protein level (10.5, 11.6, and 12.7, 14.0% moisture basis), sodium chloride (0, 1.67, and 3.34%) and sodium carbonate (0, 1.0, and 2.0%) concentrations, the latter two expressed on flour weight basis. The experimental design, which consisted of three variables at three levels, required 27 formula combinations. The combinations included a formulation having intermediate levels of the three variables replicated 10 times and tested for the purpose of measuring inherent variance in the technique. The design was randomized to increase precision. Five dependent variables were measured for each treatment. They were color, pH, firmness, mold growth, and odor. The data obtained from this study were treated by multiple regression analysis for a second-order response surface equation which contained linear, quadratic, and interaction terms for the three independent variables. The best final equation was found using the stepwise regression procedure described by Draper and Smith (1981). To determine the effects of the variables on the quality of the noodles, contour plots for each quality parameter were generated as a function of two variables while the other variable was held constant. The optimum formulation for Chinese wet noodles was obtained by superimposing the contour plots. Moisture Flour moisture contents were determined in triplicate using the Brabender moisture oven according to the AACC approved air-oven method 44-15 (1983). The semiautomatic moisture tester (Brabender Corporation, South Hackensack, NJ) was used to heat 10 g of flour at 13'C for 1 hr. Protein Flour protein contents were determined in triplicate by the standard Kjeldahl method according to method 46-1 lA (AACC 1983). The results were reported on a 14.0% moisture basis. Noodle Preparation The standard formula for this study consisted of 100 parts of flour, 30-38 parts added water, 1.0 part sodium carbonate, and 1.5 parts salt (Dick et al 1986). The optimum water absorption was determined by the appearance and handling properties of the dough sheet. While insufficient water gave a sheet with jagged edges and nonuniform surface, excess water rendered the dough sheet too extensible and difficult to handle. A dough sheet with a smooth uniform surface and sharp edges was considered optimum. The dough was mixed at high speed in a Hobart model 950 mixer (The Hobart Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Troy, OH). Water, brine, or solution in use was added over 30 sec; the mixing was interrupted at 2 min after start to scrape down the sides of bowl and beater with a spatula. The total mixing time was 5 min. At the end of the mixing stage, the mixture appeared crumbly with nodules of dough having an average diameter less than 3 mm. The mixture was transferred to the Ohtake Noodle Machine (Ohtake Noodle Machine Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) to press into an initial dough sheet by passage between smooth rolls set at a gap setting of 3.8 mm. The noodle machine was set at low speed (setting 1) to facilitate handling. The sheet was folded in half and passed between two rollers perpendicular to the fold at a roll gap setting of 5.68 mm. This cycle was repeated six times. The dough sheet was then gradually reduced in thickness without folding, by passing it between the rolls twice at each of the following gap settings: 3.8, 2.7, and 1.75 mm. A reduction (verified using calipers) in dough-sheet thickness ranging from 29 to 33% was obtained between each subsequent setting. The sheet was dusted lightly on both sides with commercial cornstarch and then passed through the cutter rolls to slit into strands. The noodle so formed was approximately 2.3 mm thick and 2.5 mm wide. The noodles were weighed and placed in polyethylene bags to rest for 30 min at room temperature (250 C). Partial Noodle Cooking Noodles (100 g) were cooked in 1,000 ml of boiling distilled water in a Pyrex beaker according to the procedure developed by Dick et al (1986). The water was maintained at a gentle boil (98 + 0.50C), the noodles were dropped into the water and stirred with bamboo sticks. The noodles were cooked for a standard time (1 min, 30 sec). They were then rinsed for 1 min under cold running tap water, drained for 1 min, weighed, placed in polyethylene bags, sealed and allowed to rest for 30 min at room temperature (25 C). Each trial was done in triplicate. Quality Evaluation of Noodles Five quality parameters were examined: color, pH, firmness, mold growth, and odor. Noodle color was measured immediately after cutting into strands, following a 30 min rest period just before cooking, immediately after cooking, and 30 min after cooking. Noodle color was determined again after 24and 48hr holding at 250C. Noodle pH was determined before and after cooking, and again at 24and 48-hr intervals. Firmness was determined after the cooked noodles had rested 30 min, whereas examination for mold growth Collapse"

104019,1990,american journal of agricultural economics,results of a price forecasting competition,results of a price forecasting competition,"Abstract The transition to competition in the U.S. telecommunications industry has been fostered under an asymmetric regulatory structure. As a result, the local exchange carriers are required to levy access charges on the inter-exchange carriers for the local distribution of long distance messages at rates significantly in excess of underlying economic costs. This rate-cost disparity has incented the inter-exchange carriers to selectively circumvent the local exchange carriers local distribution facilities and interconnect directly with their large and medium-sized business customers. This phenomenon is commonly known as bypass. This study estimates the timing of bypass adoption by establishing a relationship between bypass adoption and competitive entry in the long distance market. Specifically, the study maintains that, from the end-users' perspective, bypass appears as discounted long distance service. Hence, it is possible to analyze AT&T's loss of marketshare to competitors over time and infer a similar market response with regard to bypass. In other words, if AT&T market share erosion can be explained principally by the difference between AT&T and its competitor's toll rates, it should be possible to explain bypass adoption by the difference between what customers pay for switched access and what they would pay for bypass. Utilizing this approach, a model is developed that can be used to gauge the adoption rate of bypass. The model forecasts that bypass adoption would reach nearly 19% of switched access revenues by 1990. The evidence presented in this study clearly attests to the need to move to cost-based pricing of LEC services as rapidly as possible. Collapse"

This report is about the poor. It is thus about the fundamental issue in economic development the eradication of poverty from the world.

The evidence suggests that rapid and politically sustainable progress on poverty has been achieved by pursuing a strategy with two equally important elements. The first is to promote the efficient use of the poor's most abundant asset labor. It calls for policies that harness market incentives, social and political institutions, infrastructure and technology. The second element is the provision of basic social services to the poor (e.g. primary health care, family planning, nutrition, and primary education). The report concludes that eliminating poverty altogether is not a realistic goal for the 1990s, but that reducing it greatly is entirely possible.

Some serious scholars have even argued that the history of thought about first principles, including those governing political and social organizations, has come to an end (Fukuyama). For those who hold this view, Hegel was simply too early in forecasting the end of the evolution of thought about such first principles nearly two centuries ago. The entire Marxian experiment was nothing more than a 150-year detour which corroborated Hegel's view that the ""end of history"" coincided with the emergence of liberal-democratic states following the French and American revolutions. Regardless of whether the history of ideology is over, a new consensus on economic, political, and civil freedoms has emerged. This consensus means more than simply adjusting macroeconomic policy, achieving stability, and selling off a few government-owned enterprises in an attempt to set developing countries on a path toward broad-based economic growth. Instead, it means creating a vision of an open economy underpinned by an open polity; identifying and removing the obstacles to economic participation, obstacles that lock the ordinary citizen out of the game; enhancing the availability and utility of information resources by shaping incentives and helping to establish the basic rules of social transactions; encouraging more efficient organization of economic activity whether by market, hierarchy, or hybrid modes (Williamson) in ways that may lead to fundamental restructuring of an economy; and fostering institutional frameworks that expand the role of human choice and promote the full panoply of entrepreneurial energies.

There seem to be good theoretical as well as empirical reasons to believe that investor sentiment, also referred to as fads and fashions, affects stock prices. By investor sentiment we mean beliefs held by some investors that cannot be rationally justified. Such investors are sometimes referred to as noise traders. To affect prices, these less-than-rational beliefs have to be correlated across noise traders, otherwise trades based on mistaken judgments would cancel out. When investor sentiment affects the demand of enough investors, security prices diverge from fundamental values. The debates over market efficiency, exciting as they are, would not be important if the stock market did not affect real economic activity. If the stock market were a sideshow, market inefficiencies would merely redistribute wealth between smart investors and noise traders.

The major conclusions are first, that leveraged buyouts do not occur in RD rather, the evidence seems consistent with an agency cost and cash flow-driven model of buyouts. Second, major increases in leverage are followed by substantial declines in the R&D intensity of the firms in question, and the effect takes at least three years to work through. Finally, although the evidence on acquisitions by publicly traded firms is mixed, the basic conclusion is that any declines in the R&D intensity of acquiring firms relative to their past history appear to be associated with the leverage structure of the transaction rather than the acquisition itself.

In this respect, the role of innovations imported from other industries, the effect of raw material shortages, the importance of economic factors in adoption of innovations, and the problems presented by the heterogeneity of wood raw material and finished products are discussed. The nature of the adoption process and reasons for long lags between innovation and adoption are also addressed. Certain observations carry. implications for how research and information gathering should be conducted and what priorities should be accorded activities related to technology development and research in forest products. Many times in this century, serious timber shortages have been forecast for the forest products industry. Although the economic scarcity of some wood materials is apparently increasing (the real price of sawlogs has been rising for a long time (17)), other wood materials seem unaffected (pulpwood prices have remained relatively stable over the last four decades (28)). Thus, although numerous wood-saving technological improvements are reportedly “on the shelf ” and others are adopted rapidly by the industry, slow adoption rates for some major innovations undoubtedly reflect an appropriate response to economic conditions rather than conservatism. This paper addresses the following questions: What are some of the principal and unique influences on technological change in the forest products industry that must be understood to anticipate future rates of adoption of new technology? Do these influences currently elicit appropriate rates of technology adoption? The paper has five major sections: 1) the importance of innovations imported from other industries (interindustry flow) and other countries; 2) the effect of raw material shortages; 3) the effect of the economic performance of innovations; 4) problems presented by the heterogeneous nature of wood raw material; and 5) problems presented by the heterogeneity of finished products. It is taken as axiomatic that the impact of technological change is not felt at the stage of invention or innovation, but when improved technologies are actually used in production. For this reason, we pay particular attention to the determinants of the adoption of new technologies. Interindustry technology flow Prospects for technological change in forest products are heavily shaped by 1) commitment of resources to research and development (RD and 2) developments in industries that are remote from forest products. For example, the forest products sector has made considerable use of sophisticated electronics components, including computers, lasers, and computerized axial tomography scanners (on an experimental basis). Many industries depend upon other sectors of the economy for the expansion of their technological capabilities. In the United States, five sectors account for more than 75 percent of total RD and Research Forester, Research Forester, and Forester, USDA Forest Serv., Forest Prod.

For example, the aircraft and missiles sector accounts for the largest amount of total RD and 2) Wood products are not high technology and, therefore, are not likely to be subject to revolutionary technological breakthroughs in their manufacture and use. Such reasoning is parochial and unconvincing. The world is full of old. “mature” industries and products that have been completely revitalized by “revolutionary technological breakthroughs,” as suggested by the adoption of robots, synthetic fibers, and lasers in the textile industry — surely a mature industry. Agriculture and medicine are also mature industries, and yet they have both been transformed by revolutionary technological breakthroughs within the past 50 years. Improving the monitoring and searching activities at the interfaces between forest products and high technology industries and between domestic and foreign industries may facilitate forecasting as well as the transfer of valuable technologies in the years ahead. As we will discuss, the problem in the forest products industry is not maturity. Rather, many of the industry’s difficulties in achieving technological improvements stem from the heterogeneity of raw materials and the wide variety of requirements for finished wood products. Moreover, the adoption of new technologies is often precluded by economic considerations. Response to raw material scarcity The direction of technological change in the forest products industry, as elsewhere, is not a purely random or exogenous phenomenon, even though the industry may be affected by events that originate entirely outside the industry. Rather, technological change is influenced by the changing structure of costs of manufacturing (labor, capital, and raw materials) and the prices of competing products (plastics, steel, and concrete). Technological innovations in the forest products industry tend to have a strong labor-saving bias (11,25), suggesting that the industry tends to increase its competitiveness through improvements in labor productivity. We acknowledge that labor and capital scarcity must be considered because they strongly influence technological change. However, many innovations unique to forest products have been triggered by raw material shortages. In this section, we focus on Collapse"

Over this same period, average labor productivity growth in the United States has also been among the slowest. For the first 25 years of the period there was little cause for dissatisfaction. U.S. productivity growth was higher than it was in the prewar years, and the still higher rates in Europe could easily be explained as a catch-up phenomenon. But after 1973 U.S. labor productivity growth fell to only a little more than 1 percent a year, and in the past five years net investment has dropped substantially. Many people have argued that increasing the level of physical investment in the U.S. economy would have a large payout in higher productivity growth. We agree that investment should be increased, but we suspect that the potential productivity improvements are being exaggerated. The issue is important both for economic analysis and for economic policy. If the growth payoff from increasing the capital stock is large, economic policy can concentrate on raising national saving and investment. If the payoff is small, the nation would be wise to bend some of its efforts toward other means of improving productivity growth. From the perspective of economic analysis, we want to know how to Collapse"
104164,1990,canadian journal of economics,time and space in economic analysis,time and space in economic analysis,"In this article we examine the extent to which three minority groups were able to achieve selected neighborhood social and physical outcomes in the San Francisco mnetropolitan area. Ecological regressions were estimated to generate elasticities that measure the relative abilities of blacks, Hispanics, and Asians to convert education and income into desirable neighborhood environments. These regressions were interpreted in light of substantial differences between the three groups in levels of residential segregation. Results generally indicated a black disadvantage in the process of residential achievement, but it was not as dramatic as that found in earlier studies or as great as the levels of segregation would suggest. As in prior research, education was found to be the critical variable in explaining spatial differentiation and class stratification among blacks. In the United States, residences are allocated to persons and families through private housing markets. Since public housing comprises less than 2% of the nation's housing stock, and less than 1% of its housing starts (Adams 1987), virtually all households seeking a new residence enter the rental or sale market. Each household has a set of housing needs and desires based on its size, composition, life-cycle stage, and tastes; it also has a set of economic resources with which to achieve these desires, principally capital assets and income. Markets allocate households to specific residences through the mechanism of price; households purchase or rent the home that best suits their needs at the price they can afford (Berry & Rees 1969). According to neoclassic economic theory, the price of housing reflects the balance between aggregate demand and supply within local markets (Alonso 1964; Mills 1972). Researchers have pointed out, however, that housing is different from other commodities, and that these differences structure housing markets in distinct ways. First, residences are immobile; they are tied to a particular piece of land and cannot easily be consumed elsewhere (Logan & Molotch 1987). Second, they represent a very significant investment for most families, and for homeowners are the primary means of capital accumulation *Direct correspondence to the authors at the Population Research Center, University of Chicago, 1155 E. 60th Street, Chicago, IL 60637. i) The University of North Carolina Press Social Forces, September 1990, 69(1):15-32 This content downloaded from 157.55.39.104 on Mon, 20 Jun 2016 06:09:10 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms 16 / Social Forces 69:1, September 1990 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1986). Third, each residence is not only tied to a particular plot of land, it is also bound to a specific neighborhood (Massey et al. 1987) and, in turn, to a larger municipality (Logan 1978). Moreover, each geographic unit is associated with a social environment defined by the behaviors of residents and the service benefits provided by local government (Schneider & Logan 1982, 1985; Massey et al. 1987). Finally, houses, and the communities in which they are found, are more than mere commodities; they are also objects of powerful sentiments that influence judgments and condition decisions (Logan & Molotch 1987). In recognition of the fact that housing is immobile and linked to particular places, Charles Tiebout (1956) proposed a ""pure theory of local expenditures"" to account for the differentiated residential structure of cities. The theory rests on two key assumptions that households are free to move, and that places compete to attract them. Local governments offer different packages of tax costs, service benefits, and zoned environments from which home seekers choose. Over time, market competition produces a variety of service-tax-environment mixes and distributes households among them according to income, preferences, and wealth, yielding a residential structure differentiated by socioeconomic status, family life-cycle stage, race, and ethnicity. Although Tiebout's model recognizes some unique features of housing markets, it does not incorporate the fact that housing costs, and particularly home-ownership costs, reflect a substantial investment for families, or that homes, neighborhoods, and communities are the focus of strong emotional attachments. These traits give rise to what Stinchcombe (1965) calls ""communities of fate,"" where residents and institutions have large stakes not only in their own property, but in the property and characteristics of people in surrounding areas, making collective action highly likely. This propensity for collective action segments housing markets along social lines, so that individual choices are constrained by institutional practices and the collective behavior of others (Logan & Molotch 1987). The segmentation of housing markets, and the constraints it imposes on individual home seekers, are well illustrated by the case of U.S. blacks. The Tiebout model and its successors (Bish 1971; Peterson 1981) assume that households are free to move wherever their tastes and economic resources take them. Given this assumption, racial segregation is interpreted simply as the coincidental by-product of sorting based on income, wealth, and tastes (viz. Clark 1986). Considerable evidence, however, indicates that segregation does not stem from black preferences or low black-income levels. Public opinion polls show that blacks strongly endorse the principle of residential integration (Schuman et al. 1985) and express a clear preference for living in integrated neighborhoods, other things being equal (Farley et al. 1978). In spite of these tastes for integration, however, desegregation does not follow from the simple acquisition of socioeconomic resources sufficient to support spatial mobility. As education, income, and occupation rise, black-white segregation does not decline, but persists at a very high level (MIassey 1979, 1981; Denton & Massey 1988). Rather than reflecting tastes or socioeconomic status, black segregation appears to stem from constraints to black residential mobility imposed by the This content downloaded from 157.55.39.104 on Mon, 20 Jun 2016 06:09:10 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms Segregation and Neighborhood Quality / 17 collective behavior and institutional actions of whites. Studies of the real estate industry, for example, indicate that discrimination and prejudice are still widespread. Real estate agents systematically steer black home seekers away from white neighborhoods, and provide them less favorable treatment than whites (Molotch 1972; Pearce 1976; Wienk et al. 1979; Yinger 1986), actions which have been linked analytically to high levels of residential segregation (Galster 1986). At the same time, lending institutions have been found to finance a disproportionately small number of loans in black neighborhoods, even after objective social and economic factors are controlled (Taggart & Smith 1981; Pol et al. 1982; Leahy 1985). Moreover, in the few cases where blacks succeed in entering a white neighborhood, they are frequently met by organized white resistance and hostility (Hirsch 1983; Cass 1986; Bauman 1987), especially in working-class areas (Logan & Stearns 1981; Stearns & Logan 1986a); and if blacks succeed in establishing themselves, the neighborhood is quite likely to be avoided by subsequent white home seekers, resulting in eventual resegregation (Massey & Mullan 1984). Thus, the collective action of white residents and the institutional practices in the real estate and banking industries bifurcate urban housing markets along racial lines, fostering high levels of segregation despite a strong demand by blacks for integration. Some studies suggest that Hispanics face similar barriers, but to a lesser degree (Hakken 1979; James & Tynan 1986). The effect of a racially segmented housing market in creating and sustaining segregation is crucial to understanding the socioeconomic position of blacks in the United States. Barriers to spatial mobility are, in a very real way, barriers to social mobility. As Logan and Molotch (1987:49) point out, socioeconomic inequality among households and geographic inequality among places are not independent; the two systems of hierarchy reinforce one another: ""High status within the social hierarchy can bring access to the most desirable places ... and a guarantee of a rewarding future for whatever place one controls. At the same time a high status for one's geographical place means the availability of resources . . . that enhance life chances generally."" In a similar vein, Giddens (1980:107-12) argues that segregation is a core mechanism of class structuration, since it concentrates people of low status in space and ensures the maintenance of behaviors and orientations detrimental to success in the larger society. In this article we demonstrate how segregation structures the neighborhood environment achieved by three minority groups in one large urban area. We estimate the degree to which blacks, Hispanics, and Asians are able to convert socioeconomic achievements into selected neighborhood outcomes within the San Francisco-Oakland Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1980. The analysis proceeds in three phases. First, we establish the degree of segregation experienced by blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in the San Francisco SMSA. We then consider the extent to which the degree of segregation faced by each group affects its ability to convert status attainments into neighborhood social outcomes. Finally, we evaluate the degree to which each group is able to convert status attainments into different physical characteristics of the neighborhood environment.

The authors give a number of alternative perspectives of the same time series, in this case average thermal efficiency data from the U.K. electricity supply industry, with the corresponding conclusions associated with each approach. Particular attention is drawn to the use of the “time constant learning curve” quoted by Sharp and Price which the authors show is a reasonable predictor of the average thermal efficiency.

Fifteen factors were obtained from pertinent literature . They included audit fees, quality of audit service, industry expertise , management change, reporting disputes, qualified opinion, auditor reputation, lacked confidentiality, influence of head office , need for non-audit services , size, organisation complexity , demand by shareholders and tax services. The preliminary analysis showed that 32 out the 65 firms changed auditors during the period of study. More auditor changes occurred between 1986 and 1990 inclusive than the period between 1981 and 1985 inclusive. Quality of audit service had the highest sample mean whereas the dependent variable (AC) and tax services had wide variations when compared with the other variables. It was also shown that auditor change was common with small firms.

Firm size was first conjectured and later shown in several studies to be correlated with the availability of predisclosure information.1 O'Brien and Bhushan extend this literature by examining whether changes in firm size cause changes in the number of analysts following a firm, or whether the association between analyst following and firm size is due to the correlation between firm size and other variables. They do so by simultaneously modeling analysts' decisions concerning which firms to follow and institutions' decisions concerning which firms to hold in their portfolios. In her presentation, O'Brien emphasized that they are not testing an equilibrium model of analysts' and institutions' behavior, but rather conducting an exploratory investigation into the endogenous and exogenous factors influencing how much information is available about a firm.

DR, where IR is the inherent risk that a material error or irregularity exists in an account, CR is the risk that the control system does not catch an error given that it exists, and DR is the risk that the auditor's procedures do not identify an error given that it exists and has been missed by the internal control system. The paper also takes as given that the auditor will use a hypothesis-testing framework for decision making. These assumptions are inspired by generally accepted auditing standards. As such, the paper takes an institutional setting as given and derives the behavior implied by the institution, rather than deriving an optimal institution. Analytically, the author's methods resemble those of Fellingham and Newman [1985] (hereafter FN) and Newman and Noel [1989] (hereafter NN).1 Similar to FN, the current paper shows how the equilibrium auditee strategies may be used to determine the analogue of the prior probability distribution used in decision-theoretic analyses of audit risk. Similar to NN, the author develops comparative statics on the equilibrium strategies with respect to auditor and auditee payoffs. A key feature distinguishing this paper from the other analyses is the addition of substantive testing to the audit setting; this allows the determination of DR in a strategic setting.

104620,1990,journal of policy modeling,devaluations and credibility in structural adjustment policy,devaluations and credibility in structural adjustment policy,"Exchange-rate regimes in transition economies over the last decade have spanned the entire spectrum of possibilities, going from freely floating to permanently fixed (currency boards, DM-ization) through managed floats, preannounced crawling rates, and bands with or without intermittent adjustments. Such extreme diversity is due to differences in available foreign reserves and in initial macroeconomic imbalances (especially the presence of a monetary overhang in some transition economies) and to differences in government preferences between inflation and unemployment. Performance of alternative exchange-rate regimes is difficult to assess, (i) because performance can be mixed, (ii) because all exchange regimes if sustained have a tendency to validate themselves via their impact on inflation, and above all, (iii) because performance depends on the entire package of public policy instruments (fiscal, monetary, and structural) and on exogenous factors, as well as the exchange-rate regime itself. Poland (1990-1999) bears out these considerations. nitially (starting 1 January 1990) a fixed exchange rate was selected, pegged to the U.S. dollar at the then-prevailing free-market rate; it was backed by a $1,000 million stabilization fund provided by the G-24 which was not used but enhanced regime credibility. Monetary overhang had been virtually eliminated by earlier rounds of price increases and of zloty devaluations in 1989. Government preferences for disinflation assigned to the exchange rate the role of nominal anchor for the entire stabilization program. The fixed rate, expected to last no more than 3-4 months, in spite of massive inflation (249 percent in 1990 alone) was maintained until May 1991, when a 17-percent devaluation occurred and, the peg switched to a currency basket (full details are given in Table 1). Subsequently, concerns about externlc balance and the maintenance of trade competitiveness led to a crawling-peg regime, with intermittent additional devaluations, then to an increasingly broader band around a central parity crawling at rates progressively decreasing over time (see Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2). As in every transition economy, the real exchange rate has been steadily revalued from an initial gross undervaluation. Unlike most transition economies, however, Poland gradually has been able to consolidate the exchange rate (see Fig. 1), stabilize the crawling regime, and even experience occasional nominal revaluations (see Fig. 2).

The carbon constraint is set at 20.7% below the reference emissions level for sectors eligible according to the EU-ETS (European Union Emission Trading Scheme). Free permit distribution enhances growth despite a severe emissions cap, because environmental regulation stimulates structural changes (Porter, 1991). That is, grandfathering allows sectors additional resources to invest in developing technologies, but it also raises the CO2 abatement costs because of energy rebound effects from enhanced growth. Results under endogenous growth (Romer, 1990) are very similar to those obtained under an exogenous growth scenario (Ramsey, 1928), as the substitution effects are responsible for the majority of variations; in addition, Romanian research activities are too modest to significantly impact this system. The abatement cost per unit of GDP is higher under endogenous growth, as spillover effects reduce incentives to invest. Technological diffusion continues to have a positive impact on economic growth, which counterbalances the free-riding attitude adopted by some energy-intensive sectors, such as glass and cement.

104708,1990,monthly labor review,earnings inequality accelerates in the 1980's,earnings inequality accelerates in the 1980s,"Introduction Though the question of how income is distributed among individuals is one that has long puzzled social scientists, it is only recently that scholars have refocused their attention on the dynamics of inequality in industrialized economies (Atkinson 1997; Conceicao and Galbraith 2001). In large part, the resurgence of interest in the subject has been driven by a series of empirical studies seeking to identify and explain changing patterns in the earnings and employment structure of the United States and the United Kingdom during the late 1970s through the 1980s. Most notable among these trends are well-documented cases of increases in the inequality of wages, for both men and women, as well as significant increases in earnings differentials by skill (Burtless 1990; Bound and Johnson 1992; Katz and Murphy 1992; Levy and Murnane 1992; Freeman and Katz 1995; Jenkins 1995, 1996; Goodman et al. 1997; Gottschalk et al. 1997). In Canada, similar studies of income distribution find that inequality increased throughout the 1980s, albeit at a less pronounced pace than in the United States or United Kingdom (Blackburn and Bloom 1991; Freeman and Needels 1991; Card and Freeman 1994). More recent empirical evidence, however, suggests that the pace of inequality has picked up during the 1990s. Data at the national level show that growth in total income inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) among Canadian households accelerated from a 2.9 percent increase over the 1981-1989 period to a 6.5 percent increase from 1990 to 1999. A look at provincial-level data reveals even more pronounced variations. Across the provinces, family income inequality increased modestly and even decreased in a few cases during the 1980s. However, from 1990 to 1999, it increased significantly: for all provinces except Saskatchewan the growth in inequality ranged from about 2 percent in Manitoba to as much as 9.7 percent in Ontario and 11.4 percent in Newfoundland. Despite the evidence that inequality is on the rise in Canada, there remains little agreement as to the causes of such an increase (MacPhail 2000; see also Bluestone 1996 and Storper 2000 for more general perspectives). Several competing explanations have been offered. Factors tied to globalization (trade, immigration, FDI) figure prominently among them and given Canada's greater integration into the global economy there may be some credence to this line of explanation. (1) Other explanations focus more closely on deeper structural changes occurring within economies, namely, those related to technological change, deindustrialization and demographic shifts. Yet others focus on changes to various institutional factors such as declining unionization and real minimum wages or cutbacks to social programs. To examine the potential contribution of these different sources of inequality, most studies use decomposition techniques of one sort or another. While these certainly have merit, trying to quantitatively determine the precise portion of the rise in inequality explained by each possible cause can be quite problematic (Freeman and Katz 1994; Bluestone 1996; U.S. Congress Joint Committee 1997). Above all, the downside of this approach is that it tends to force researchers into limiting the scope of their investigation on only a few specific explanations at a time (MacPhail 2000). In reality, it is most likely that the observed rise in inequality stems from a 'mixed cocktail' of several possible factors (Bluestone 1996; Cline 1997; Gottschalk and Smeeding 1997). The goal of this article is to explore the relationship between rising income inequality across Canadian provinces and the various causal explanations offered in the literature. This question has been examined previously: MacPhail (2000), in particular, offers an excellent entry point into the investigation of the various possible causes of rising inequality in Canada during the 1980s (see also Morissette 1996). … Collapse"
104710,1990,monthly labor review,helping poland cope with unemployment,helping poland cope with unemployment,"This article discusses an approach to working with large groups of students traumatized by a common crisis. Initially, identified as Classroom Crisis Counseling (Brock, 1996; Brock, Sandoval, & Lewis, 1996), this model was influenced by Terr's (1992) discussion of mini-marathon groups. Recently, the author's training in critical incident stress management (Mitchell & Everly, 1996b) led to several significant modifications that are included in the current discussion. The most obvious modification was re-labeling the model as Classroom Crisis Intervention (CCI). This was done to help clarify that crisis counselors are not required to implement this type of intervention (Galante & Foa, 1986). While, mental health professionals will typically play an important role in CCI, it is not crisis therapy. It is best thought of as psychological first aid. As such, it is appropriate for almost any school professional to be a CCI facilitator. As a coordinator of a school crisis intervention team for the past 7 years, the author has had numerous opportunities to use this model. Although designed to be employed following traumatic events (i.e., a school shooting and the witnessing of fatal traffic accidents), CCI has also been used to assist in the management of grief reactions. The author has found CCI to be effective in dealing with these events, and it is hoped that the present article will stimulate further study. General CCI Issues and Procedures Who should participate in CCI? Any group of students having difficulty coping with a common trauma could be brought together in a CCI. As a rule CCI groupings are relatively homogeneous (Mitchell & Everly, 1996a; Weinberg, 1990; Wollman, 1993). Groups can be identified according to several logical categories, including classroom membership, age, grade, familiarity with victims, and / or degree of exposure to a traumatic event (Pitcher & Poland, 1992). However, following major school-wide disasters, CCI is perhaps best employed with naturally occurring classroom groupings. The author has found that the connections already developed by classmates facilitate group sharing and support. It would, however, be appropriate to hold a separate session for those students from different classrooms who were most directly involved with the trauma. Also, it may be necessary to exclude from CCI students who are displaying severe stress reactions (Johnson, 1993). These students, whose crisis reactions may interfere with CCI, will require one-on-one crisis intervention. What is the optimal size of the CCI group? CCI is effective with classrooms ranging in size from 15 to 30 students. Combining classrooms and creating groups of more than 40 students is not recommended (Bell, 1995; Mitchell & Everly, 1996a). Large groups are likely to limit group sharing and interfere with the expression of feelings (Schonfeld, 1989). Where and When Should CCI Be Offered? Whenever possible CCI should take place in the students' regular classroom (Schonfeld, 1989). Traditional counseling settings should be avoided (Farrington, 1995). In this way the unnecessary labeling of students as patients is prevented (Klingman, 1987), and the normality of crisis reactions reinforced. This setting also provides structure and routine that are not only reassuring but also facilitate CCI's group processes. A classroom's rules will make it easier to progress through CCI steps. Also, it is suggested that the normal desk arrangement be used. In general, the physical environment should be as normal and natural as possible. Mitchell and Everly (1996a) have observed most adult emergency service personnel (e.g., firefighters, paramedics and police) must be well defended to perform their jobs.

Currently, only one-third of all disabled Americans with disabilities work, although the remaining two-thirds who are not working would like to have a job, but may or may not be looking for one. However, data show that more than 15 percent of individuals with disabilities are unemployed compared with approximately 5 percent for the general population. For young disabled people, the employment situation has been even worse. The Disability Advisory Council, a commission created by Congress to study the effectiveness of the current Federal employment/disability policy and programs, noted in its 1988 Report to Congress that few high school graduates with developmental disabilities make a successful transition from school to sustained, gainful employment. It is estimated that in 1986, more than 90 percent of these special education graduates became dependent in some way after high school. What are other countries doing to ease the transition process? This report, which is based upon the findings of two cooperative U.S.-Organization for Economic Cooperation Development (OECD) activities, describes employment policies and programs to aid disabled young jobseekers in Japan, Sweden, Italy, Denmark, and the United States.

An analytical framework for assessing the magnitude of the structurally induced volatility is presented. The ratio of variance of open-to-open returns to closeto-close returns is shown to be consistently greater than one for NYSE common stocks during the period 1982 through 1986. Tbe greater volatility at the open is not attributable to the way in which public information is released since both the opento-open return and the close-to-close return span the same period of time. Instead, the greater volatility appears to be attributable to private information revealed in trading and to temporaryprice deviations induced by specialist and other traders. The implied cost of immediacy at the open is significantly higher than at the close. Other empirical evidence in this article documents the volume of trading at the open, the time delays between the exchange opening and the first transaction in a stock, the difference in daytime volatility versus overnight volatility, and the extent to which volatility is related to trading volume.

We reexamine the issue of phenotypic discrimination against Mexicans in the U.S. labor market, originally studied by Telles and Murguia (1990) and later by Bohara and Davila (1992). We also seek to explain this topic with respect to the Puerto Rican and Cuban populations in the United States. Methods. Instead of using household income as a dependent variable, we use occupational ranking scores computed by Hauser and Warren (1996) in combination with data from the 1990 Latino National Political Survey (LNPS). The occupational rankings more accurately reflect the level of labor market discrimination faced by individuals. Furthermore, the use of the more recent LNPS allows us to update the work of previous scholars and extend the analysis to two previously unexamined Latino groups—Puerto Ricans and Cubans. Results. Our findings indicate that darker‐skinned Mexicans and Cubans face significantly lower occupational prestige scores than their lighter‐skinned counterparts even when controlling for factors that influence performance in the labor market. However, we find no conclusive evidence that skin‐color differences impact occupational prestige scores for Puerto Ricans. Conclusions. Using earlier data, some scholars found evidence for difference in labor market performance among Mexican Americans as a function of phenotypic variations among Mexican Americans. Today, dark‐skinned Mexican Americans and Cuban Americans continue to face higher levels of discrimination in the labor market, whereas dark‐skinned Puerto Ricans do not, which may indicate regional differences across the three groups that need to be controlled for.

Law restricts financial institutions from holding large equity blocks and from networking the small blocks they do own. Impetus for these restrictions came from several sources: a public-spirited belief that financial stability would be fostered by financial fragmentation, American federalism (each state created its own insular set of financial institutions), rivalries between groups of financial institutions, and popular mistrust of powerful private financial institutions. The stability of many of these rules also derives from the political resistance that one would expect corporate managers and benefited financial institutions to offer to any change. Collapse"

This paper provides background information on the current state of child health, nutrition, and health care in the United States, and on medical conditions and public health problems relevant to academic achievement and the functioning of schools. The paper begins with observations about the relationship between child health and learning. Several ways in which ill health can interfere with the learning process are outlined. The paper touches on the influence of economic disparities in child health status, health limitations, the infant mortality rate, frequency of medical care, place of care, health insurance coverage, nutritional status, and birth weight. The paper concludes by noting that there is a link between child health and educational outcomes, but even substantial progress in improving children's health status cannot be relied on to dramatically alter group differences in academic achievement.

105364,1990,population research and policy review,the potential of child care tax credits to reduce poverty and welfare recipiency,the potential of child care tax credits to reduce poverty and welfare recipiency,"As more and more mothers of young children enter the work force, interest in government financing of child care grows. The chief government subsidy for child care is the child care credit in the federal Internal Revenue Code. This is a nonrefundable credit and therefore provides benefits only to those with incomes high enough to require them to pay income tax. Yet of the $ 5.5 billion spent by the federal government on child care in 1986, this program accounted for $ 3.5 billion.This paper simulates the effects of expanding the child care tax credit by (1) doubling the reimbursement rates of the current credit; (2) making the credit refundable; and (3) both making the credit refundable and increasing its value for all families with income below $ 32,000.Results suggest that these changes will have modest effects on the income and earnings of mothers, and on the poverty gap and welfare recipiency. Costs, however, differ substantially. Doubling the value of the credit is far more expensive than either making the credit refundable or making it both refundable and more generous at the bottom of the income distribution. Making the credit refundable may cost taxpayers very little by leading to increases in hours worked and concomitant reductions in welfare payments. Collapse"

It is argued that, while the growth of black business ownership in emerging fields is a sign of black economic progress, overall trends in black business ownership are not entirely positive. For one thing, the divergent trends in traditional and emerging black-owned firms reflect widening socioeconomic disparities within black communities. Moreover, the decline of traditional black-owned firms bodes ill for disadvantaged blacks in inner-cities. After reviewing the development of black business enterprise in the United States, trends in black business ownership since the 1970s are examined. Patterns of change in traditional personal services and emerging business services are then linked to social and economic transformations that have enabled many blacks to participate in the larger national economy. The article concludes by discussing the implications of declines in traditional black businesses for black well-being and for public policy. Collapse"

The economic and social policies that initiate and maintain the substantial flow of federal transfer payments to the Puerto Rican population is likely to reduce the opportunity costs among women participating in the informal economy; therefore, informal labor market participants will have fertility levels more like women who have never worked than like women active in the formal labor market. Using data from the 1982 Puerto Rican Fertility and Family Planning Assessment, this paper compares fertility differentials among ever-married women who have never worked, who have ever worked in the informal economy, and who have only worked in the formal economy. Contrary to expectations, the fertility levels of informal labor market participants are more like those of formal labor market participants; economic activity in either sector is associated with bearing fewer children. Federal transfer payments do not appear to reduce the opportunity costs of reproduction among women employed in the informal economy.

The changes are analyzed using two methodologies: decomposition analysis and a t-test of the mean differences of the balance sheet and of its component parts. The study examines changes in total assets, total liabilities, and the balance sheets as a whole, and then disaggregates the assets and liabilities to determine where the changes occurred in each group of banks. The findings show statistically significant differences in the average proportions of assets and liabilities between the two groups: minority banks held more cash than nonminority banks, fewer loans, more premises, a higher volume of other assets, more common stock and lower undivided profits. Although the wide differences in the structural changes of assets and liabilities began to narrow in 1985–1987, the analysis indicates the differences may again be increasing between the two groups.

Determination of the incidence of harassment and its major sub-types is difficult because of problems with sampling (e.g., response rate, sample size) and instrument construction (e.g., number or variety of harassment categories). Additionally, severity of harassment is rarely treated as a variable.Several resolutions to these problems are presented. First, estimates of the proportion of women who have experienced harassment, as well as the proportion having experienced the major sub-types of harassment, are derived. Second, a mutually exclusive and exhaustive set of sexual harassment categories, which includes harassment types that have evolved recently from legal decisions and policy developments, is discussed. Finally, an outline of factors which might be used to assess harassment severity is presented. Resolving these issues will provide social scientists and non-scientists alike with clearer answers to the ‘How much?’, ‘Which types?’ and ‘How serious?’ questions about harassment. Collapse"

The use of these techniques is motivated by the need to analyze voluntary restraint and ather measures that now restrict a sizeable fraction of world trade. The bilateralism in such arrangements generates the added efficiency cost that buyers will typically not purchase from their least-cost source of supply. From a computational point of view, the presence of bilateral quotas increases the dimensionality of the equilibrium fixed-point problem by a factor equal to the number of trading countries and commodities for which quota restrictions apply. Bilateral quotas are first analyzed in pure exchange economy for which the Gale-Nikaido mapping must be modified for existence and computation of equilibrium. This is followed by a discussion of the extensions needed to incorporate production. An application of the computational techniques to the analysis of global restrictions on trade in textiles and apparel under the Multi Fiber Arrangement is presented, and, in a final section, further areas of potential policy application are discussed.

The analysis also includes gold prices and samples of daily foreign exchange prices over 15 years. The mean absolute changes of logarithmic prices are found to follow a scaling law against the time interval on which they are measured. This empirical law holds although the distributions of the price changes strongly differ for different interval sizes. Systematic variations of the volatility are found even during business hours by an intra-day analysis of price changes. Seasonal heteroskedasticity is observed with a period of one day as well as one week as the result of an analogous intra-week analysis; taking this into account is necessary for any future study of intra-day price change distributions and their generating process.

I also consider the trade-conflict model of Polachek (1980) and its extensions, as one example of expected utility in international relations. I raise three questions concerning the impact of expected utility: (1) when does trade mitigate conflict? (2) can trade provoke conflict? (3) can trade induce cooperation? From a review of empirical findings, I consider the political content of the trade-conflict model in particular, and of expected utility models, in general. Subsequently, I discuss two additional questions: (4) how do exchange norms influence trade and conflict? and (5) what incentives exist to foster cooperation from trade under expected utility? I advance the critique that while expected utility underrepresents political actions and motives, the implicit content of politics in the trade-conflict model is predominantly realist. Given this tendency, expected utility in conflict resolution and peace science will invariably be used to model strategic and geostrategic concerns. Collapse"

It is based on an integrated system of econometric models for each major country or region of the world. Currently the system consists of 79 models. The total number of equations is more than 20,000, and the LINK data set contains more than. one million observations. In Project LINK, it is assumed that model-builders know their own country best. Each model-builder is, thus, free to design their country's model in all respects except that (1) each country model needs to generate four categories of imported goods in real terms, and the associated four price export indices, and (2) the demand for real exports from each country and import prices in each country for the four categories of imported goods are to be generated by the LINK system. In this manner, a feedback mechanism operates. It is also possible to estimate changes in exchange rates, because in the leading industrial countries these rates are either related to internal and external variables or linked to the major foreign currencies. Because of its feedback characteristic and its flexibility, it is possible to incorporate in each country model certain variables that are important for the model of the world solution. For example, government consumption or military spending in each country may be interlinked and during simulation an outcome of the world model solution will influence the individual country results. In this work, we present the possible outcomes of military cuts in the Soviet and Eastern European economies using appropriate macroeconometric models. These models are based on the economic model of a centrally planned economy, described in the next section. In Section 3, we present some results of the simulation exercises. Collapse"

Needless to say, in the minds of many, arms control and environmental management are the two most important problems confronting the world today. However, before spelling out the advances scored, it is pertinent to say a few words about the role and relevance of global modeling. There are, as is well known, scholars and analysts skeptical of the usefulness of big models who will undoubtedly be even more skeptical of the usefulness of still bigger models such as the one envisioned in this paper. They will make the usual claim that such big models are beyond the understanding of any one individual and that no one can understand the detailed operation of a model that embodies 50,000 equations, let alone the 20,000 in the LINK submodel to be used. Yet there are other scholars expert in a particular part of the global model who do, or should, recognize how, from the operation of a global model, some key variables in one part are linked to one or more key variables in other parts. Then there are other scholars who perhaps lack the ability to examine and fully understand in detail the operation of any part but who do have the capacity for perceiving the grand picture-for seeing how the parts are interconnected in the main, and for understanding those connections, For each part of a global model, one or more of these scholars will undoubtedly have the capacity for identifying an expert who understands that part in depth. The scholar, thus, can assemble a team to direct the use of each part in a global model operation. Finally, to reiterate, no model ever replaces intuition in both theorizing and attaching significance to any set of generated numbers. Collapse"

The economic literature is critically reviewed and another approach is advocated. This alternative approach rests on the distinction between product and process innovations. It is argued that the relationship between process innovations and health expenditures can be illuminated by determining if the process innovation and the original procedure are utilized as substitutes. The empirical results provide no indication that alternative technologies for diagnosing diseases/conditions of the upper gastrointestinal tract have been utilized as substitutes by Australian medical practitioners operating on a fee-for-service basis.

The surplus lag rolling estimation is applied to deal with the problem of the frequent structural changes in the Chinese monetary system. We found that the monetary policies have become less effective in stabilizing the price level in the deflation era that started from 1998. There is also empirical evidence to suggest that money was endogenous in China during the inflation period. This implies that the People's Bank of China had difficulty exercising the power of money supply to reduce inflation if the endogeneity was the result of the market behaviour. However, if the endogeneity was due to the government inflation-targeting rule, then there is no evidence to suggest that this rule has been effective for M0, M1 and M2 instruments, except for the M0 instrument during the inflation period of April 1990 to March 1995. Although it was found that money ceased to be endogenous in the deflation periods, it does not support the proposal of utilizing the money supply as a policy instrument, as we found that money is impotent in influencing price in the deflation regime. Our findings provide some empirical evidence to support the Chinese government adopting alternative policy instruments such as an active fiscal policy in the era of deflation. Collapse"

This paper was prepared for presentation at the American Agricultural Economics Association Meetings, San Antonio, TX, July 28-31 , 1996. Endogeneity Testing inTurkey Meat Demand Introduction While many researchers have focused on issues of demand estimation and industry structure in the livestock and poultry sectors, few have addressed these concerns specifically for the U.S. turkey industry. Previous poultry studies have generally concentrated solely on broiler chickens (Knoeber and Thurman, 1995; Moschini and Meilke, 1989) or have analyzed an aggregate poultry commodity (Thurman 1986, 1987). However, the dissimilar production and consumption patterns of turkeys and broiler chickens, the primary poultry commodities, suggest that studies addressing demand and industry structure issues would benefit by individually examining each industry. In this paper, the specification of the demand equation for turkey meat is analyzed. Specifically, the issue of treating either price or quantity as a predetermined variable in the demand equation is investigated. The U.S. Turkey Industry Although the organizational structure of the turkey industry parallels that of the broiler chicken industry, still there is reason to examine the turkey industry as one distinct from the broiler industry. Production and consumption patterns strongly differ between the two commodities. Whereas more than 90 percent of broiler chickens are produced via production contracts, the number of integrators contracting with farmers to grow turkeys is closer to 60 percent of total production (Knutson, Penn and Boehm 1995). Company-owned farms, marketing cooperatives, or independent farmers account for the rest of turkey production. Also in contrast to broilers, which have a short 5-6 week production cycle, the production cycle for turkey poults is approximately 5 months from the time of hatching to slaughter. Most of the turkeys marketed reach an acceptable market age and weight between 4-7 months. Finally, turkey production itself is highly seasonal. In 1960, more than 50 percent of all turkey consumption took place during the last three months of the year. In 1990, 35 percent of yearly turkey consumption still occurred during the last quarter with November, not surprisingly, as the highest consumption month (Perez, Weimar and Cromer 1991). Consumption and marketing standards have also been changing in the turkey industry. Especially notable is the increase in per capita consumption and the decrease in real turkey prices (Figures 1 and 2). Since 1960, the real price of turkey has declined by almost 150 percent while per capita consumption has nearly tripled. This relationship is not unique to the turkey industry, broiler chicken consumption has followed a similar trend, but it is unusual relative to pork and beef consumption. Contributing to the changes in the turkey industry are the new processing and marketing practices that have increased the accessibility and convenience of turkey meat for consumers. Ground and formed turkey products, such as turkey bologna, turkey ham and turkey hot dogs, have become standard items in deli and meat counters. All of these factors increase the value of studies specific to the turkey industry and raise the issue of how to specify the demand equation. Demand Specification Demand equations may be specified in one of three ways. The textbook treatment is a system of simultaneous equations that treat both price and quantity as endogenous variables in a 2 supply and demand framework. Alternatively, based on consumer preferences and the structure of the particular industry, there are cases when either price or quantity is argued to be predetermined in demand. For instance, given a price supported commodity, price may be treated as the exogenous and quantity as the endogenous one provided that the support price is binding during the period investigated. A more popular way to interpret the argument for predetermined price is the concept of fixed short-run retail prices. Again, for data evaluated within a particular time, price adjustments do not occur, rather, quantity adjusts to clear the market. Finally, price may be predetermined in annual data in a competitive industry that faces constant returns to scale and elastic factor supplies. In this case, price is determined by input costs and demand determines quantity. Thurman (1987) argues that this is indeed the case for annual poultry data for the period between 1955 and 1981. 1 Arguments for predetermined quantity also are found in the literature. The most popular one suggests that supply is perfectly inelastic due to the perishability of nonstorable commodities. Here, production decisions made well in advance of harvest cannot be altered at the time of market. Consequently, quantity is fixed and price adjusts to clear the market. It is not clear, a priori, if either consumer preferences or the structure of the turkey industry would cause price or quantity, if either, to be predetermined in a demand equation. Thurman's research suggests that price is predetermined in annual poultry data. However, given the production and consumption differences between broilers and turkeys, it is not necessarily 'An anonymous referee intuitively noted that free trade may be an additional argument for exogenous price. In this case, the world price is viewed as predetermined and quantity adjusts to absorb demand disturbances. 3 clear that this would hold for turkeys as well. The question of whether price or quantity, or neither, can be treated as predetermined in a demand equation is examined by using the WuHausman test. The Wu-Hausman Endogeneity Test The Wu-Hausman test for endogeneity was developed by Wu in his 1973 paper, Hausman in a later 1978 article, and applied to the poultry industry by Thurman in his 1986 and 1987 studies. The logic behind the Wu-Hausman test is this. Under the null hypothesis of no misspecification, both an OLS estimator, b, and an instrumental variables estimator, b · , will be unbiased and consistent estimators of the right-hand side variable (either predetermined price or quantity). However, under the alternative hypothesis of misspecification, the OLS estimator is no longer unbiased and consistent. If the null hypothesis is true, the difference between the two estimates, q = b b · , will have a probability limit of zero. If misspecification is present, then the probability limit of q will differ from zero. Based on this relationship, the Wu-Hausman test for endogeneity uses the following test statistic: w =cc b')[V(q)r c6 b'). Here, [ V(q)] is a consistent estimator of V(q). Under the null hypothesis of no misspecification, Wis distributed asymptotically chi-square. As pointed out by Hausman, construction of this test statistic is simplified by noting that under the null hypothesis of no misspecification, asymptotically V( q) = V ( b ·) V ( b) . In the case of either predetermined price or predetermined quantity, q is a scalar. Collapse"

The findings suggest that although monetary authorities have some control over the money supply changes can be exogenously determined.

This phenomenon can be verified only by modelling the market by disequilibrium methods. In this paper, a model of price adjustment in non-clearing market is presented and tested by using autoregressive techniques. It is found that excess demand for hospital care has been the source of disequilibrium for a large part of the period of the study, 1965–1984. It is observed then the key factor causing excess demand is low out-of-pocket expenditure for hospital care by patients due to third-party payments. Had the co-insurance rate been adjusted upward or co-payment patient rate not fallen, excess demand would have been eliminated.

However, I would like to comment on two challenges to research in this area. Firstly, abnormal illness behaviour covers a broad spectrum of doctor-patient relationships from malingerers who concoct symptoms for their own benefit, to patients who have no conscious control over their functional symptoms and gain no obvious advantage from them. These polar groups illustrate the complexities of attempting to delineate and understand this behaviour. Whether somatization disorder is a useful step in this direction is debatable. We found the arbitrary diagnostic criteria! excluded individuals with more severe abnormal illness behaviour than the somatization disorder patients, in terms of frequent GP consultations, multiple hospital referrals, and being poor copers with life in general. We concluded that the concept of somatization disorder had little value in British primary care'', Secondly, somatization disorder does not delineate a group of patients who always present with symptoms in the absence of organic disease.

Briefly, the arguments is that the speed of price adjustment is a function of market structure: in competitive markets prices are flexible (they adjust rapidly to supply and demand shocks), but in oligopoly they can be relatively rigid (they adjust only slowly, if it all, to these same shocks). 1 But, because the theoretical basis fot the rigidity hypothesis is decidedly ad hoc, it is often summarily dismissed. 2 Empirically, however, a number of studies for various countries and time period have found relationship between concentration (a proxy for oligopolistic market structure) and price change and/or some other measure of the speed of price adjustment, compatible with price rigidity. 3 Although these result are not totally unambiguous, 4 the Canadian evidence, at least prior to the 1970s, strongly supports the rigidity hypothesis (Sellekaerts and L...

The analysis of privatization policy, however, cannot be complete without specific attention to the market structure in which the firm operates and in particular to the interdependence between the ownership status and market structure. I examine a dupolistic market and demonstrate that a partly nationalized firm might realize higher profits than its private, profit-maximizing, competitor. The degree of nationalization also affects the interaction between an incumbent firm and a potential entrant. Using A. K. Dixit's framework, I consider the implications of privatization on the attractiveness of entry, the possibility of deterring entry, and the incumbent position as a natural monopoly. It is shown that it is possible that a firm is not a natural monopoly while being private but that alteration of its ownership status can transform it to a natural monopoly. Such an analysis establishes my main claim that ownership status may affect the market structure in which firms operate. Collapse"

We use real data for the Southeast and Northeast regions of Brazil, which are subject to different taxes rates. Design/methodology/approach – The framework of this study is based on Real Options valuation. We valued the option to switch between sugar and ethanol production. The dynamics of prices was based on the recombinant trees of Nelson and Ramaswamy (1990) and on the bivariate trees of Hahn e Dyer (2011). Empirical data is from the Center of Advanced and Applied Economic Studies (CEPEA), ESALQ-USP, from May/2003 through July/2014.

This was accompanied by an increase in current account deficits in excess of 3 per cent above what they had been in the previous decade. (See Khan and Knight, 1983, for a discussion; these authors find the terms-of-trade shocks the major cause of the deficits.) This has led to a renewal of interest in the effects of changes in terms of trade for a small open economy. The conventional wisdom, first put forward by Laursen and Metzler (1950) and Harberger (1950), emphasized the fact that a terms-of-trade worsening lowered real income, which in turn lowered savings and worsened the current account-the Laursen-Metzler Effect. The recent reappraisal was initiated by Obstfeld (1982). He showed, in an infinite-horizon-optimizing framework with perfect capital mobilizing, that if the discount rate was a function of the level of utility, surpluses, and not deficits, accompany an unanticipated and permanent terms-of-trade worsening. The long-run level of the discount rate is tied down by the given world rate of interest. This in turn fixes the long-run level of utility. The terms-of-trade shock tends to lower the level of utility and agents save to offset this. Across steady states there is only a substitution effect. On the other hand, if the discount rate is fixed and equal to the world interest rate, then the economy adjusts to the terms-of-trade shock by immediately lowering real expenditure by the same amount as the decline in real income so that the current account is always balanced. Svensson and Razin (1983) showed that in a two-period framework this does not necessarily happen. For the infinite-horizon case they showed that, if preferences were separable over time and the discount rate was increasing in instantaneous utility, then Obstfeld's results were indeed obtained. In a two-period overlapping-generations model, the results could be modified owing to the fact that human wealth and non-human wealth are not perfect substitutes and a terms-of-trade shock affects these differently. (See Matsuyama, 1988, for a discussion.) But it is still true that an unanticipated permanent terms-of-trade shock has a one-shot effect on the current account unless some ad hoc costs of adjustment are introduced (see e.g. Persson and Svensson, 1985, and Matsuyama, 1988).

Taking this approach, In this paper try to apply the integrative approach as well as fuzzy theories and independent multi-indexes technique in uncertain conditions (known as TODIM) to identify uncertainty present in assessing criteria that influence price index of the stock market.

The fiscal part of each country’s economy is considered to supply financial resources needed for the expansion of true economic transactions generally including dollars and financial markets. The state of price index in the stock market is an important criterion to evaluate financial markets of countries which has been used as an important way in order to examine the stock market internal and external feedbacks and as a base for decisions made by investors. The application of price index of shares is extensive and important for both investors to put money into private jointstock sector and as economic index from macroeconomics’ perspective, for shares of companies and manufacturing and economic sectors are exchanged in the stock market. For that matter and recognizing the importance macroeconomics policies and variables as well which can have a considerable effect in the capital market, the present paper, for the first time, attempts to prioritize financial factors influencing the stock market price index using fuzzy TODIM technique. The fuzzy property used here considerably increases managers and decision makers’ capability of decision making in assessing each criterion so that opinions could get closer to reality. Strong mathematic foundation of this technique, on the other hand, as opposed to other methods in the area of MCDM has considerably increased its capability to support outcomes in validity and reliability. Next we review the literature. Then fuzzy TODIM method is introduced and last section will consider a case example, pointing out its numerical results. Literature review A lot of attention has been paid to factors influencing the stock market price index to identify and measure types of factors and their influence in today’s complex, fast-changing environment. Therefore, making reference to the relevant theories, we present an integrative, exhaustive model. Investigating the short and long term relations between inflation rate and true nominal price index in the U.S. in a 132 month time period (1991-2003), Kim and In (2005) found the shortterm relationship between the two variable is negative but the long-term relationship is the opposite. They concluded the relationship between inflation and price index is varying in time and depends on the time of investigation (kim and in, 2005). Gan et al (2006) examined the relationship between New Zeeland’s stock market index with seven major economic variables through 1990-2003, indicating that there is a significant relationship between the stock market index and the independent variables during the term (Gan et al, 2006). Based on Bhanot (2006)’s theory, we take account of political factors as the criteria being considered. According to him, government’s interventions impact on the stock market index, and unusual outcomes during the period would depend more on general activities from the government than its specific interventions. This is more n consistent with the impact of information than that of price pressure. Public ownership maintenance positively influences the stock market price performance (Bhanot, 2006). We adopted structural factors from Boardman and Claude’s (2000) theory suggesting that firm’s size has a negative impact on the stock market price performance (Boardman and Claude’s, 2000). Amiri (2009), in his theory, argues that managerial factors and marketing can influence shares price. In other words, he explains that managerial factors play a role in the company’s success or failure and, consequently, in shares price (Amiri, 2009). In their theory, Kevin and Vinod (2001) suggest Total International Journal of Scientific Management and Development ISSN:2345-3974 Vol.3 (6), 414-423 June (2015) 415 International Journal of Scientific Management and Development Quality Management (TQM) has effect on shares price and that TQM could bring wealth to the organization. Based on all said above, marketing and managerial factors can be adopted from the extant theories (Kevin and Vinod, 2001). Bartram (2007) considered how shares price as opposed to currency and inflation rates was affected, demonstrating amongst all economic variables, market interest rate and currency rate has the main effect on shares price index (Bartram, 2007). Amiri (2009) came to conclusion that disclosure of financial inventories, as a financial factor, influences shares price index (Amiri,2009). In his research, Jamshidi (1988) concludes the ratio of price on income impacts on shares price index. Examining the effect of mental factors from past variation in shares price on tendency to shares purchasing and price index, Huddart et al (2006) confirmed such effect exists. Scholars have found that the extent of transactions matters more, both in terms of statistics and economy, when the current prices exceed the prices of last year. The past highest price acts as a reference for investors to decide whether or not to purchase shares (Huddart et al, 2006). We have concluded that past variation in shares influence investors’ decision as to whether to purchase shares. Investigating effect of various factors on shares prices, Boardman and Claude (2000) confirmed such an effect and identified such factors as government, gold share, type of industry, and time periods (Boardman and Claude, 2000). Examining the relationship between a company’s shares price and the average price of other companies’ shares, Heins and Allison (1996) concluded that changes in a company’s shares price is contingent on numerous factors rather than the average stock of shares in the market which is not considered here. Considering the relationship between a company’s shares price with the average price of other firms’ shares, they found that the average price of other firms’ shares has no effect on variations in a company’s shares price and that its shares price is dependent on other variables and factors and is independent of the average price of other companies’ shares (Heins and Allison, 1996). In their study, Kalev, Liu and Pham (2002) found an increase in the extent of transaction, price variations, and news coming to the market in the beginning and ending of each day’s transaction suggest positive inter-relationships between these variables (Kalev, liu and pham, 2002). Based on the theory of effective markets, Ivsia (2001), of MIT, examined the financial behaviors of shareholders in the U.S. NASDAQ stock market in relation to the ways in which they make decisions over the shares of high tech companies; results showed that shareholders’ decisions over such shares aren’t in accord with the extant theories of financial management, and in spite of low gains and low EPS of such companies, their shares are increasingly on demand, because of shareholders’ expectations of bright future of these companies (Ivais, 2001). Epstein (1994) points to firms’ annual fiscal reports as invaluable and insignificant factor on investors’ decisions. The fuzzy TODIM Combining fuzzy set theory and TODIM is a novel approach. TODIM is a Crete multi criteria method founded on prospect theory (Kahraman et al, 2003) The TODIM method has been successfully used and empirically validated in different applications (Gomez et al,1992; Tzeng et al,2002). This method is based on a description, proved empirically, of how people make effective decisions when faced with risk. Although not all multi criteria problems address risk, the shape of the value function of TODIM is identical to prospect theory’s gain and loss function TODIM’s multi criteria value function is composed in parts whose mathematical descriptions reproduce the gain and loss function The global multi criteria value function of TODIM then aggregates all measures of gains and losses by considering all criteria. Introducing expressions of losses and gains in the multi criteria function is incorporated into the TODIM formulation. Gomes et al (2009) apply TODIM to investigate and recommend options for upstream projects for the natural gas reserves recently discovered in the Mexilhão field in the Santos Basin, Brazil. In addition Gomes and Rangel (Gomez et al, 2009) presented an evaluation of residential properties with real estate agents in Brazil and def Collapse"

This study follows the methodology employed by Frucot and Shearon (1991), finds similar empirical results, but reaches quite different interpretations and conclusions. While Frucot and Shearon interpreted their results as suggesting caution in the use of participative budgeting by US companies operating in Mexico, we find that Mexican managers working for US controlled maquiladoras in Mexico may exhibit cultural values much like their US counterparts and that the performance of these Mexican managers may benefit from budgetary participation.

These findings suggest that auditors' decisions may be more complex than indicated by some previous research, and that additional research is necessary to identify conditions in which auditors utilize configural processes. This study investigates the role of environmental risk factors on the configurality of audit decisions. That is, we test whether the systematic consideration of audit risk variables results in the identification of higher order, interactive decision processes where linear relationships have previously been detected. The findings of Libby et al. (1985) and existing audit pronouncements are used to develop hypotheses regarding auditors' internal audit decisions.1 The hypotheses concern (1) the interactive effect of inherent risk and control strength on the extent to which auditors rely on internal audit functions to reduce planned audit work and (2) the extent to which these environmental factors affect consideration of three components of internal audit quality: objectivity, competence, and work performed. Audit managers from a Big Six accounting firm responded to a series of audit-planning cases concerning the receivables cycle of a mediumsized manufacturing firm.

106325,1991,economic development and cultural change,what happened to political development?,what happened to political development,The subject matter of economic development and political development intersects over a broad front. Economic policy is made by incumbent politicians in the context of political institutions. The analysis of the economic impact of alternative policies is the stock in trade of the economist. The choice of the alternative policies that are subjected to economic analysis is influenced by the agendas of political parties and interests. The subject matter of political science includes the political decision process by which policies are adopted and implemented. It also includes the social consequences and the public response to policy. There is a deep fault line that divides scholarship in the two fields. Each field tends to treat the knowledge it draws on from the other as implicit rather than explicit. It seems apparent that the implicit theorizing by economists about political development and of political scientists about economic development should be replaced by more specific attempts to develop an integrated theory of political and economic development. Political scientists and economists loosely grouped within the collective choice school of political economy have advanced our understanding of the proceses by which economic resources are translated into political resources and political resources are translated into economic resources.' But a similar convergence of theory and analysis has not yet been achieved among students of political and economic development. This article represents an attempt to assess what development economists could learn from theory and research in the field of political development to advance knowledge and policy in the field of economic development. I proceed by first reviewing the contributions of several development economists who have attempted to give explicit attention to the political preconditions or conditions for economic development. I then review the evolution of thought in the field of political development. This leads me to a discussion of the central problem Collapse

That is not true anymore. At least since Clifford Geertz's seminal discussion of the bazaar and firm types of economies in a Javanese town, many studies have appeared that have focused on informal retail trade.' In contrast to this, the formal retail sector has received less detailed and systematic attention.2 This neglect is unfortunate. It is not known whether the formal trade sector in the urban Third World is growing at the expense of the informal one, but there is little doubt that in most societies it is expanding in absolute terms. This development needs to be studied because it is especially through this sector that innovations are introduced that cause a transformation in the character of Third World urban trade, consumption patterns, and culture from traditional forms to ones attuned to a mass market. To offset this neglect, in this article I will clarify certain ambiguities concerning the concept of formal retail trade and describe the formal retail sector of a secondary city in India in order to suggest the degree to which it has introduced modern/Western themes into the local trade community.

106328,1991,economic development and cultural change,the transition from high to low marital fertility:  cultural or socioeconomic determinants?,the transition from high to low marital fertility cultural or socioeconomic determinants,The authors test whether socioeconomic variables in England and Wales between 1850 and 1900 are significantly related to decline in fertility during a transitional period marked by no family planning at the onset. In contrast Carlsson study of Swedish fertility decline ascribes the decline to the diffusion approach from urban to rural and adjustment perspective which emphasizes societal setting and boundaries. Knodel and van de Walles macro analysis within the Princeton European Fertility Project (PEFP) presents the view that simultaneity occurs despite a variety of socioeconomic and demographic conditions. Lesthaeghe followed the innovative argument and reports that within the diffusion process cultural barriers put limitations on the extend of fertility. Conversely socioeconomic interpretations have been developed by Teitelbaum who also used the PEFP data and Friedlander in his analysis of 600 districts of England and Wales. Teitelbaum identifies the significance as socioeconomic with cultural variables having separate significant effects at later stages. Friedlanders somewhat different theory indicates that nuptiality marital fertility and migration are micro-interrelated and result from socioeconomic change. Crafts analysis of the 1911 fertility census in England and Wales reveals that spacing and stopping contributed to fertility decline instead of Knodel and van de Walles thesis of stopping being the only significant determinant. The authors analysis of 600 districts of England and Wales validates the adjustment hypothesis by showing that socioeconomic and demographic timing account for variation in timing of marital fertility (R2 = .50). In explaining the diffusion process again with R2 = .54 socioeconomic variables entirely account for the fertility change dependent variable with no effect from the cultural variable. This was substantiated in repeated trials at regional levels also testing the strength of the language variable. Further testing of the mode of transmission from urban to rural indicated the fertility change variable was not negatively related to the urban proximity variable including a separate regression for just London and environs. The Carlsson diffusion hypothesis is rejected. 24 repeated stepwise regressions were performed confirming the importance of the socioeconomic and demographic variables in explaning fertility decline with a minimum of 50% (range 70 - 90%) of the variation explained. Cultural and diffusion variables explain no more than 50% (range 5 - 25%). The largest beta coefficients for all equations with demographic and socioeconomic variables. The Lesthaeghe border hypothesis is also not substantiated. The Framework of Social Structure and Fertility is advanced as the significant analytical construct for understanding fertility decline. Notwithstanding the English experience other recent studies are reviewed which support the socioeconomic interpretation and suggestion is made to further research effort in this direction. Collapse

Preschool children account for a disproportionately large share of the deaths in most developing countries. Nutritional deprivation is either directly or indirectly associated with most of those deaths. The very young are less able to cope physiologically with nutritional deficiencies than older children and adults. In addition, children who suffer a loss of growth due to early nutritional deprivation have only a limited capacity to overcome the resulting stunting. For these reasons, there is particular interest in the determinants of the nutrition and health status of preschool children in developing countries.2 Collapse"

106351,1991,economic inquiry,"extending the equation of exchange:  dual equations, for output  and input",extending the equation of exchange dual equations for output and input,"EXTENDING THE EQUATION OF EXCHANGE: DUAL EQUATIONS, FOR OUTPUT AND INPUT I. INTRODUCTION As a framework to organize thinking about inflation, deflation, and recession or depression, an equation of exchange is often useful: either Irving Fisher's MV * PT where T is an index of all the economy's transactions during a time period (final real output, inter-firm, resource input, and even existing assets), or the more modern MV * PY where Y is an index of final real output only. (1) But neither equation directly and explicitly considers resource input prices and quantities. Doing so can illuminate a variety of economic events and issues. Because the all-transactions equation of exchange integrates less easily with modern macroeconomic models that explain Gross or Net National Product, our point of departure is the final output equation of exchange, MV * PY. We treat it as an identity that summarizes a larger macro-economic model, not as a non-tautological ""quantity theory of money"" that holds only in monetary equilibrium. (2) II. AN EQUATION OF EXCHANGE FOR RESOURCE INPUTS An equation analogous to the equation of exchange for output can be defined for resource inputs, giving dual equations of exchange: MV * PY and MV * WX, where W represents an index of resource input prices, and X an index of real resource inputs used. (The equation MV * PT has no such unexploited analogue, because it already encompasses all the economy's transactions.) Substituting and rearranging shows that nominal output equals nominal income, (3) and the ""productivity ratio"" of output to input quantities equals the ""input reward ratio"" of input to output prices: PY * WX and Y/X * W/P. Assume also a production function, relating the economy's output capacity to the resource inputs available: Y = f(X). The U.S. government routinely estimates the value of M,P,Y, and hence of V * PY/M, and private research has extended these estimates back to the 1800s, but there are no annual estimates of W and X for the entire economy, although at least in principle they could be estimated. Meanwhile, albeit empty empirically, (4) they are useful constructs. Dual equations of exchange make it possible to discuss directly not only production but also incomes--and income issues can fascinate students for whom the equivalence of real output and income may be a dimly understood abstraction. Illustrating Dual Equations of Exchange Dual equations of exchange formalize the ""circular flow of economic activity"": while resource inputs flow from the household to the producing sector, and real output flows from the producing to the household sector, money in exchange flows in the opposite direction. This circular flow depicts a world in which households ultimately own everything and therefore buy all final output while supplying all resource inputs and receiving all income: on the diagram's top half, MV represents the flow of money out of the household sector and PY represents the flow of money into the producing business and government sectors on the diagram's bottom half, MV (again) represents the flow of money out of the producing business and government sector and WX represents the flow of money incomes into the household sector. Clearly, MV * PY and also MV * WX, because payments must equal receipts, for output and for resource inputs. Also, PY * WX and Y/X * W/P, because households own everything and thus receive all funds that flow in to the producing sector. The Ownership Perspective: Justification and Implications For students, the diagram's ownership perspective needs some justification and elaboration: Workers of course belong to households all private businesses are owned by some person or group all governments are controlled (the essence of ownership) by some person or group (be they voters, politicians, bureaucrats, or despots), who by definition are part of the household sector. … Collapse"

For example, clustering effects of subject effects in repeated-measure experiments can cause the variance of the observed proportions to be much larger than variances under the multinomial model. The phenomenon is generally referred to as overdispersion. Tallis (1962) proposed a model for identically distributed multinomials with a common measure of correlation and referred to it as the generalized multinomial model. This generalized multinomial model is extended in this article to account for overdispersion by allowing the vectors of proportions to vary according to a Dirichlet distribution. The generalized Dirichlet-multinomial model (as it is referred to here) allows for a second order of pairwise correlation among units, a type of assumption found reasonable in some biological data (...

106420,1991,journal of economic dynamics and control,intertemporal issues in international macroeconomics,intertemporal issues in international macroeconomics,"Recent work in macroeconomics in general, and in international macroeconomics in particular, has emphasized the need to base such models on firm microeconomic underpinnings. Essentially, this has come to mean that the underlying behavioral relationships are derived from some form of intertemporal optimization by representative agents, with particular attention being devoted to ensuring that the equilibrium is consistent with the intertemporal resource constraints facing the individual and the economy. While it is fair to say that macroeconomic theory is increasingly being carried out within this type of framework, there are eminent economists who remain skeptical of what this approach has to offer. This view is expressed most forcibly by Riidiger Dornbusch, who in the introduction of his recent collection of essays writes: ‘Although much of policy-oriented open-economy macroeconomics stands unproved, I am impressed with near-complete sterility of the intertemporal approach in the face of actual policy issues. Perhaps as it matures in the hands of some of the excellent scholars now working in that mode, it will come to yield a richer harvest.’ This special issue of the Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control is devoted to studying intertemporal issues in international macroeconomics. There are two features to the intertemporal approach which those who adopt this framework find to be attractive. First, by deriving the model from underlying microeconomic principles, much of the arbitrariness associated with macroeconomic modeling is eliminated. But the extent to which this is accomplished should not be overstated, since a good deal of arbitrariness inevitably still remains. The nature of the objective function, the range of decision variables, the specification of the constraints, all typically remain subject to choice. Secondly, by explicitly introducing some intertemporal measure of welfare, the intertemporal approach provides a natural frame- Collapse"

Economic analysis suggests some loss of output would also be incurred. This paper supplies some estimates of the net benefits by examining how the output-inflation trade-off varies as a function of the degree of exchange rate stabilization, for each of the G3 economies. It appears that exchange rate stabilization may give (Pareto) superior results for output and inflation, compared to a free float, but that outcome is the exception rather than the rule because the advantages of greater exchange rate stability are usually offset by greater monetary instability. Coordination as well as exchange rate stabilization is needed to secure price discipline without output losses. Copyright 1991 by Scottish Economic Society. Collapse"

Income effects of the adjustment lead to a transitory current-account surplus because the deleterious effect of the tariff on national income is larger in the long run than in the short run. In addition, relative prices ‘overshoot’ in response to the tariff, leading to an increase in the consumption rate of interest which, in turn, generates an increase in desired saving. Collapse"

The dynamic-game model developed here potentially can generate diverse patterns of macroeconomic behaviour, patterns that differ as a result of assumed differences in government objectives. Under some types of government, the ongoing strategic interaction between the public and private sectors leads to a disinflationary outcome. Other governments may push the economy into a spiral of rising debt and inflation. Collapse"

Cooperation is required to achieve a Pareto optimum with respect to the two utilitarian national social welfare functions. Cooperation and international side payments are required to achieve an optimum with respect to a utilitarian global social welfare function. Without international lump-sum transfers, when distortionary taxes on capital income are permitted, Pareto optima with respect to national social welfare functions and global social welfare optima will not be individual Pareto optima: efficiency is traded off for a more desirable intergenerational and international distribution of resources. With nationally provided international public goods, the achievement of individual Pareto efficiency requires coordination of public spending but not of financing. Collapse"
106441,1991,journal of environmental economics and management,global environmental problems: the effects of unilateral actions taken by one country,global environmental problems the effects of unilateral actions taken by one country,"Abstract In global environmental problems, each country's own contribution to worldwide emissions is small, so there is little a country can do by itself. To solve global environmental problems one needs coordinated actions between countries. Environmental groups often advocate that in spite of the global character of the problem, a country ought to take unilateral actions to reduce its environmentally harmful emissions. The argument for such unilateral actions is that they at least give a contribution in the right direction (however small), and also that by “setting a good example” of this type one might affect the behavior of other countries, and/or improve the chances of reaching international agreements of coordinated reductions of harmful emissions. The paper gives an analysis of the consequences of unilateral reductions of harmful emissions. It is shown that such a policy will generally affect the outcome of international negotiations about reduced emissions. The outcome of such negotiations may very well imply higher total emissions when one country reduces its emissions unilaterally than if both countries act selfishly. Collapse"
106442,1991,journal of environmental economics and management,how to set catch quotas: constant effort or constant catch?,how to set catch quotas constant effort or constant catch,"Abstract This paper considers whether the total allowable catch from a fish stock should be a fixed annual quantity or based on constant fishing effort. It consists of two parts, a theoretical part and an empirical part based on data from the Arcto-Norwegian cod stock. In the theoretical part it is shown that realistic cost and revenue functions have opposite effects on whether a constant quota or a constant effort yields the highest expected profit. A concave revenue function implies that a constant quota will be preferable, while a stock-dependent unit cost of landed fish has the opposite implication. The empirical part investigates how large the difference between the average profit yielded by the two strategies is likely to be, on the basis of some stylized facts about the Arcto-Norwegian cod stock. The size of this stock fluctuates considerably over time, due mainly to fluctuations in the size of year classes. Spectral analysis indicates cyclical movements, and so a sine curve was used to generate recruitment cycles. The difference in average profit yielded by the two harvest strategies is very small in most cases, or of the order of 1–2%. This result is relatively robust with respect to alternative specifications of the cost and the revenue functions, but a maximum difference of 20% was produced by a non-stock-dependent unit cost of fish and a kinked revenue function, where catches exceeding a certain quantity are worthless.

106457,1991,journal of mathematical economics,communication requirements and strategic mechanisms for market organization,communication requirements and strategic mechanisms for market organization,"Abstract A mechanism realizes an objective if, when agents are honest, the objective is met when the mechanism is used. A mechanism implements an objective if, when agents act strategically, the objective is met when the mechanism is used. This paper addresses the question: do we incur an ‘informational cost’, in terms of increased communication requirements, when we insist on implementation of the (constrained) Walrasian correspondence as opposed to, simply, its realization? Communication requirements of a mechanism are measured by the size of its message space. We prove the existence of a mechanism that implements the (constrained) Walrasian correspondence with a message space which is no larger than that of the competitive allocation mechanism. We explore implementation with quasi-games which generalize games in the sense that they have outcome correspondences. Since a quasi-game designer is free to specify a set of outcomes rather than a single outcome for each strategy profile, a smaller amount of information needs to be conveyed to the center. We prove our result using a quasi-game whose solution is well-defined and invariant with respect to alternative beliefs held by agents about selections from the set of out-of-equilibrium outcomes.

According to the monocentric model, households locate to maximize the utility received from housing and all other goods (= income commuting costs housing costs). If households are otherwise indifferent among housing locations, and if there is one worker per household, utility-maximizing location choices minimize aggregate commuting distances, given the location of houses and jobs. The fact that average actual commutes are about 8 times the average minimum commute casts doubt on the validity of the monocentric model. Hamilton’s findings suggest that one should modify the monocentric model to incorporate other determinants of location choice. In the discrete housing-choice literature, for example, households receive utility from neighborhood amenities, as well as from the commuting distances of all workers in the household. When utility is defined in this way, utilitymaximizing location choices need not minimize aggregate commuting distances; thus, the more general location-choice model may explain the divergence between average-actual and average-minimum commutes. In this paper we examine by how much a broader definition of utility of residential location raises the average required commute. Specifically, we (1) estimate a utility function defined over housing and neighborhood attributes as well as the commuting distances of all workers in the Collapse"
106486,1991,journal of urban economics,urban land value functions with endogenous zoning,urban land value functions with endogenous zoning,"The main objective of the present research is to develop a methodology for the generation of trips using Geographic lnformation Systems and Remote Sensoring. According to the new developments in this technology, it is now possible to sectorise an urban structure, through the analysis of the data obtained from aerial photographs. Furthermore, this sectorization allows the systematic identification of sectors with similar characteristics. These characteristics allow the definition of the geometric and photographic patterns in the urban structure, which can be grouped up to form ""Homogeneous Aggregated Sectors"" (HAS). Based on the fundamentals from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS), using the treatment of aerial photographs, a methodology was developed for the analysis and classification of the data from these images that results in of ""Photo-!nterpreted Classes"" (PIC), which are grouped up to form ""Homogeneous Aggregated Sedors"" (HAS). With respect to the case study of the town of Sobradinho, 16 PlCs and 15 HASs were identified. Furthermore, based on the relationship of these classes with the census data obtained from IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica), the formulation of a model for the generation of trips was developed. This model of trip generation factors for each class, in Sobradinho town was obtained. This results shows the relation between land use pattern and trip generation. In this study, the highest value was obtained in residential sectors with buildings with many floors while, mixed occupation patterns, such as residences and workshops or residences and comercial area, presented low value comparing with residencial patterns. It was also verified that the factor values of a class are influenced by the age of the area. 1 INTRODUCTtON In the Transportation Planning process one of the main activities is to estimate the trip demand. It aims to determine the amount of trips generated and attracted by a traffic zone, that will be essential to continue the process. In this sense, it is fundamental to determine the characteristics and patterns of trips (type, place of origin and destination, etc.). In order to estimate the trip demand, the traditional methodologies require the attainment of a large number of information. These information are not only related to the system itself, but the socio-economic data of the population. Usually, it can be reached through extensive collection of data related to individual trips, that are called origin destination research. This collection phase consume the most part of the time and demand the use of expressive human and financial resources, making the process sometimes invalid for most cities, principally the small and medium sized zones. The trip generation / attraction variables are extremely dynamic in developing countries. Because of this rapid development, which has a narrow relationship with the transportation system and urban activities, it is necessary to obtain information about the trip characteristics. Then, these information has to be collected continuously for the analysis and the establishment of the future behaviour of the trips. This fact has as consequence the increase of the planning process costs and the necessity to develop alternative forms to collect, process and analyse the data for trip generation. In this paper a trip generation model is presented, based on land-use patterns and land inhabitation, obtained through the association of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS). in search of speed and effectiveness in the attainment of information for transportation planning. This paper is structured in five sections. In the first section, the traditional trip generation models are discussed. The RS and GIS concepts are treated in the second section. In the third one, the formulation of the developed model is presented. A case study in the town of Sobradinho (District Federal Brazil) and the viability of the model are described in the fourth section. Finally, the conclusions are presented in the fifth section. 2 EvALGATiQN QF THE GENERATION MODELS The evaluation of the trip generation models shows a typically static level of analysis, since they don't possess resources which can enable them capture the urban changes related to land-use at a quick rate. Also, the large quantity of data needed to execute the modelling, impedes the updating of these data in a quick and continuous way, due to the high operational cost. These restrictions make the modelling, and evidently, the treatment of transportation problems complex. All these lead to the need to rely on tools which permit the treatment of large quantities of data, in a rapid and precise form, and at the same time facilitate the intervention of the modelling process in an interactive and dynamic way. In this sense, some attempts can already be observed. Silva et al. (1 995) developed a simplified model which facilitates the generation of trip rates, making use of GIS. Despite the effort involved in obtaining the additional data, one can still observe a strong dependence caused by lack of data, leading to the least exploration of the functional characteristics of GIS, together with other technologies. 3 GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN TRANSPORTATION (SIG-T) AND REMOTE SENSING (RS) The Geographic Information Systems can be defined as a type of information System which involves databases, technology and staff in a systematic and interactive way, in order to execute spatial analysis (Dantas et al., 1996). These analysis are defined by Goodchild (1988) apud (Gatrell, 1991) as a group of analytic methods which demand access to the attributes (properties) of the study objects and information of their location (georeference). Spatial analysis plays a fundamental role in the treatment of graphic data (aerial photographs and satellite images) obtained from Remote Sensing, thereby permitting the attainment of essential information for the treatment of transportation problems, not simply as a viewing tool and data storage, but as a direct planning instrument. The potential to be explored with the use of GIS and RS in transportation studies has presented considerable results. Recently, Bartoli et al. (1996), Taco et al. (1996) and Yamashita et al. (1 997), obtained essential information to evaluate the accessibility of locations at bus stops; traffic zoning of the urban area through the definition of Aggregate Sectors, to analyse the intervening variables in attracted and produced trips, and the definition of bicycle routes, respectively. 4 TRIP GENERATION MODELLING WITH THE APPLICATION OF GIS AND RS This model seeks to relate land-use patterns with the trip generation of a determined area. In other words, we intend to determine the rate of generated trips function in the inhabited area, for each type of urban construction. It is necessary to identify and characterise the different land-use patterns, in order to later correlate them mathematically with the trips. The modelling process is divided in five stages namely, identification and characterisation of photo-interpreted classes (PC) and Homogeneous Aggregate Sectors (HAS); definition of involved variables; structuring and formulation of mathematical theory; and mathematical calculus of the factors of trips generated in the area. In the modelling process, it is necessary to create data layers in the GIS software, which can relate transportation in terms of levels, types and location of the socioeconomic activities within the urban context. In this model, the land-use layer maps, the ""censitaire"" sectors (CS), the traffic zones (TZ), and the photo-interpreted classes are assumed to be created in GIS. With respect to land use, the existent distribution and type of use must de defined. In the ""censitaire"" sectors and traffic zones, demographic and socio-economic data must de aggregated, together with the limits and location of their centroids. On the other hand, the location of the centroids and their areas within the CS and TZ are important for the PICs. SCANNER 7 1 GEOREFERENCE REGISTER AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS Collapse"

Methods Population‐based survival for 20 adult malignancies was estimated for the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Data on adults (15–99 years) diagnosed between 1991 and 1999 in England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland (1993–99) and the Republic of Ireland (1994–99) were analysed. All cases were followed up until the end of 2001. Relative survival was estimated by sex, period of diagnosis and country, and for the nine regions of England. Predicted survival was estimated using the hybrid approach. Results Overall, cancer survival in UK and Republic of Ireland improved during the 1990s, but there was geographic variation in survival across the UK and Republic of Ireland. Survival was generally highest in Ireland and Northern Ireland and lowest in England and Wales. Survival tended to be higher in Scotland for cancers for which early detection methods were in place. In England, survival tended to be lower in the north and higher in the south. Conclusions The geographic variations in survival seen across the UK and Republic of Ireland are narrower than between these countries and comparable European countries. Artefact is likely to explain some, but not all of the differences across the UK and Republic of Ireland. Geographic differences in stage at diagnosis, co‐morbidity and other clinical factors may also be relevant. List of Tables, 9 Collapse"

106501,1991,public choice,"the ""mess"" of the public industrial production in austria:  a typical case of public sector inefficiency?",the mess of the public industrial production in austria a typical case of public sector inefficiency,"Summary and conclusionThe economics of property rights, the X-efficiency approach, the economic theory of bureaucracy, the public choice theory and the findings about union-controlled firms have been used to explain inefficiency in the public sector in general. These approaches, however, have been rarely applied specifically to public industrial production in competitive markets with private goods characteristics. In Austria a sixth of the industrial production takes place in public enterprises. Until lately there were neither thorough audits nor strict efficiency controls by the government or administration. For a long time the obvious inefficiencies were tolerated by the taxpayers, the government and even by the opposition. Moreover in the Austro-keynesian era the public industrial firms were implicitly used for reaching the government's stabilization policy goals immediately. This brought about big losses and created a heavy burden on the federal budget. Nonetheless the microeconomic consequences of this kind of Austrian public industrial policy have not been analysed satisfyingly.Discussing the Austrian situation we assert that the above-mentioned approaches can be well applied for capturing the mess of the public enterprise operating in competitive private goods markets. On this theoretical base we form hypotheses of comparatively low productivity, high labor cost, high investment rates, strong growth of output and low profits (high losses) in the public industrial sector. We test our hypotheses by employing statistical means tests and regression analyses. By and large our hypotheses are supported by the empirical findings with one prominent exception: Despite the presumed input-maximizing behavior of the public managers, the low threat of illiquidity following investment failure in public enterprises and the evident stabilization behavior of public industrial firms it surprisingly turns out that the private industrial sectors largely show higher rates of investment as compared to the public ones. The most striking results indicating inefficiencies of public industrial enterprise can be obtained with respect to labor cost efficiency and profitability. Overall productivity is also unambiguously lower in the predominantly public industrial sectors. The pursuit of stabilization goals by public industrial firms can be identified empirically by comparatively high labor costs as a consequence of expansionist wage policy strengthening the demand for consumption goods and by the relatively strong trend of turnover.We argue that in the end it has always been the logic of collective action which has rendered inefficiencies in the public sector possible: The inherent lack of incentive to exert effective control of an efficient use of public resources and the institutional incentive to utilize this condition selfishly for personal and political goals are responsible for the pertinacity of inefficiencies caused by the factors mentioned at the beginning of Section 4. As for the Austrian case we demonstrate that this holds true even for economic environments as transparent as competitive markets. In this perspective the mess of the public industrial enterprise in Austria is indeed a typical case of public sector inefficiency. On the other hand this problem is not necessarily doomed to persist. The turn of mind in the Austrian public opinion and industrial policy in the mid-80s may serve as a “proof” for it. However, to achieve a permanent solution to the problem one would have to enter the domain of constitutional economics and policy. If Austria wants to continue her way in this direction the present situation looks promising. Collapse"

The first view, associated with Olson and Zeckhauser, argues that the public good aspect of defense induces free riding behavior by smaller alliance members, which imposes a disproportionate burden of supporting the alliance on the larger members. A second view argues that NATO defense activities produce a mix of outputs, some of which are not purely public, and some of which may be complementary across nations. Furthermore, the nature of the weapons systems and their relative use by alliance members may induce substantial cooperation by allies. The test proposed here analyzes the relationship between defense spending shares of NATO members and their population and relative wealth shares. A simple model is specified and tested using pooled time series cross sectional data. The empirical results indicate more support for the cooperative view of ally relationships than the Olson-Zeckhauser non-cooperative model. Collapse"
106508,1991,public choice,public sector employee voter participation and salaries,public sector employee voter participation and salaries,"The hypothesis advanced by Downs (1957) that rational, utility-maximizing citizens would calculate the benefits and costs of voting in deciding whether to vote often has been employed to argue that voter participation rates among government employees should exceed that of comparable private sector individuals. The basic rationale for that prediction was laid out by Downs (1957: 254) who argued that ""those who stand the most to gain are the men who earn their incomes there."" Higher voter participation rates for government employees coupled with an implied preference for the expansion of the public sector has also played a role in efforts to explain the growth of government (Borcherding, Bush and Spann, 1977; and Bush and Denzau, 1977). In addition to benefiting from the supply of public goods and services, as do all voters, government employees are seen as benefiting from the expansion of government through an increase in their salaries. In this paper, the issue of voter participation rates for government employees is reexamined. Current Population Survey (CPS) data tapes containing information on individual voter behavior for the 1984 and 1986 national elections are used to estimate a qualitative choice model.1 Consistent with previous findings, the results presented indicate that government employees, as a group, are more likely to vote than are private sector workers with similar socioeconomic and demographic characteristics (Wolfinger and Rosenstone, 1980). Unlike previous studies, however, we distinguish between federal and state and local employees. This distinction is important. Building on the Downsian hypothesis that the cost and benefits of voting matter, the arguments offered in the following section lead to the prediction that the probability of voting should be lower for federal employees than for state and local.

106512,1991,public choice,"rights, equity, and economic efficiency",rights equity and economic efficiency,"Summary and conclusionsThe Adelman-Morris premise that economic development and equity are incompatible is not supported by the evidence of a strong relationship between equality of rights and the income distribution. The premise that equity requires the denial of individual rights and the affirmation of state control is an oxymoron. What has been overlooked in the literature on growth and equity is the effect of the rights structure on both economic efficiency and on the income distribution. The evidence is that free societies have much larger shares of income going to the middle 60 percent of the distribution than is observed in societies where men are not free to choose. In politically open societies compared to politically closed regimes the share of income to the middle three quintiles is: Q2 (10.7 vs. 8.0), Q3 (16.0 vs. 11.5), and Q4 (22.9 vs. 17.9). In the aggregate the shares to the middle quintiles are 49.6 vs. 37.4. In nations that obey the rule of law compared to regimes in which the rights of the state relative to the individual are paramount the comparisons are: Q2 (11.2 vs. 7.4), Q3 (16.3 vs. 10.6), Q4 (23.0 vs. 17.3). Summing the three quintiles yields a comparison of 50.5 vs. 35.3. In countries that have private property, market allocation of resources, and minimum intervention by the state compared to command economies the shares of income to the middle quintiles are: Q2 (10.8 vs. 8.0), Q3 (16.0 vs. 11.1), and Q4 (22.8 vs. 17.7). Aggregated the shares of the middle class in regimes with high levels of economic liberty are 49.6 vs. 36.8 for regimes with restricted private economic rights.Equally revealing as a matter of equity is the status of the poor and the rich in free and statist nations. The income share of the highest income group is much larger in nations that repress individual rights than in those where rights are protected. Averaging across the rights measures the share of income going to the highest income quintile is 58.3 percent among the least free nations and is 44.4 percent among the most free, a staggering difference of nearly 14.0 percentage points. Among the poorest members of society choice of the rights regime does not have much of an impact on their share of income. While the share averaged across rights measures is larger in the most free nations (5.7 vs. 5.3), the difference is not statistically significant.3 Economic progress and equity are not incompatible. Nations can move to a less restrictive rights regime and increase economic efficiency, economic growth, and equity. Collectivism is a lubricious path to economic progress and equity. Using Ward's composite inequality index, they correlated the Ward measure with GNP per capita, Gastil's rights measures, and a number of other policy and quality of life variables. They found evidence that choice of economic system (capitalism vs. socialism) had no effect on the inequality measure, but that inequality diminishes with increases in civil and political rights.

106513,1991,public choice,an empirical investigation of interstate afdc benefit competition,an empirical investigation of interstate afdc benefit competition,"Claims that states which offer generous welfare benefits attract the poor and that some states pay low benefits intending to drive the poor away are neither uncommon nor entirely unfounded. This paper employs a two player (state) generalized game to model states' choice of a benefit level in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Migration by the poor in response to interstate differentials in earnings and welfare opportunities, and the subsequent changes in AFDC caseloads, drive this game.Estimation of the model (using 1979 data) suggests that states within approximately 750 miles of each other do engage in a benefit-setting game. The rival's initial number of poor and preference for non-AFDC consumption appear to be the more influential rival characteristics.These findings, while derived from a different methodological approach, are consistent with previous studies which indicate that welfare recipients tend to move toward higher benefit states. Such migration may impede the efficient spatial allocation of labor. The results also indicate that states will tend to offer lower benefits given recipient migration than would be the case otherwise. State jurisdiction over benefits consequently leads to underprovision of AFDC. Federalization of the AFDC program would improve efficiency in terms of the spatial allocation of labor and the provision of AFDC. Collapse"

To the extent that Democratic legislators, because of their ideology, are more willing to forgo national policymaking for local benefit-seeking than their Republican counterparts, rational voters have an investment incentive to: (1) lean Democratic when it comes to casting ballots for an individual representative to Congress — thereby attempting to secure as large as possible a slice of the total government spending pie; and (2) lean Republican when it comes to races for the presidency — so as to limit the net losses imposed by the prisoner's dilemma game that local benefit-seeking by Congressional representatives entails.The foregoing theory naturally depends on the validity of the assumption that Democratic legislators engage in greater local benefit-seeking than their Republican counterparts. By examining roll call attendance rates this paper provides some empirical support for such an assumption. To the extent that roll call votes concern national policymaking issues, Democratic legislators appear to be more willing than their Republican counterparts to forgo taking part in the resolution of such issues for the sake of narrower, local-benefit seeking activities such as casework and the pursuit of pork barrel.

106518,1991,public choice,privatization and government size,privatization and government size,"The Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) is responsible for land use regulation and public development in the city of Boston. As part of its responsibilities, it has managed the disposition,'by sale and by ground lease, of real property owned by it and by other public entities. From 1980 to 1991 it has used property disposition to achieve a wide variety of different policy results. Financially, it obtained long-term streams of revenue for itself, allowing it to become fiscally independent in operations, and obtained over $80 million of sale proceeds for Boston's general fund. Its dispositions have also produced or sought to produce such social benefits as affordable housing, public access to the waterfront, and economic development of distressed neighborhoods. In its disposition activities, the BRA has managed its properties as a portfolio to maximize public benefits and has utilized the strength of the private real estate market to leverage the creation of public benefits, demonstrating a strong spirit of creativity and public entrepreneurialism. This thesis is the first systematic examination of the BRA's disposition strategy. Chapter One demonstrates the importance of dispositions as a means of carrying out public policy objectives. Chapter Two examines the response of the BRA's disposition strategy to the external factors of parcel size, location, and ownership, the real estate market, and political priorities. Chapter Three discusses the BRA's disposition policies in light of its overall institutional goals, its organizational structure, and the administrative processes by which it manages dispositions. Chapter Four examines specific dispositions to show how the BRA converted real estate into other financial and social assets. Chapter Five discusses the implications of the BRA experience for other cities and examines some of the policy dilemmas raised by the BRA's disposition strategy. Thesis Supervisor: Lynne B.

Because it is possible that knowledge retrieval is a function of the manner in which information is stored in memory, this study also investigates two kinds of knowledge organization: (1) a taxonomic representation, as typified by categoric checklists; and (2) a schematic representation, as typified by information flowcharts. Although the relationship between knowledge and expertise is well documented in the literature, few accounting researchers have attempted to study the memory structures of skilled individuals (Libby and Frederick 1990; Weber 1980). Thus, this work is motivated by two broad objectives: (1) to understand the nature of expertise, which will help in assessing the boundaries of auditors' abilities and performance; and, (2) to comprehend the cognitive skills of both expert and novice auditors, which will help in facilitating skill acquisition by unseasoned individuals. One hundred thirteen auditors and 97 auditing students were used to study the retrieval characteristics of the taxonomic and schematic knowledge structures and memory differences between experts and novices. Auditors freely recalled more internal controls when such controls were organized by transaction flow. Auditing students did not possess complete knowledge organizations, and the type of representation did not affect their free recall of the controls. Across a given knowledge representation, providing subjects with complete subsets of internal controls as a memory aid did adversely affect the retrieval of additional controls in the taxonomic but not the schematic organization.

The groups had similar clinical and demographic characteristics at baseline. After the intervention program, significant improvements in cognitive function were observed in the IG, but not in the CG. Particularly, a significant improvement in motor control, spatial working memory and visuospatial associate learning were depicted in the IG, which revealed an overall better cognitive performance as compared with the CG after the follow-up period. The results clearly identify physical exercise as an effective non-pharmacological tool to positively modulate age-related decline in cognitive function in older adults, particularly when prescribed in a personalized approach with a multicomponent structure as foreseen in the innovative AGA@4life model.

106551,1991,accounting review,a perspective on cognitive research in accounting,a perspective on cognitive research in accounting,"Abstract Spatial language has been traditionally understood as encoding purely spatio-geometric information. However, much more than that must be considered for a full account of the semantics of space. It turns out that spatial arrangements manifest functional consequences which are non-spatial, so prepositional vehicles cannot be equated solely with spatial elements (Vandeloise 1991, 1994). These non-spatial parameters in turn, play a major role in spatial, non-spatial, and temporal conceptions. This provides solid ground to propose a motivation behind these types of meanings that prepositions usually convey. This paper attempts to show how the conceptual basis for each preposition proposed, is a key component within conceptual processes such as elaboration and extension (Langacker 1987). Such an analysis provides a better understanding of the spatial configuration of the English and Spanish prepositions, as well as an account for the semantic extension of non-spatial and temporal conceptions. Using a corpus-driven methodology to evidence the prepositions’ use types, the results obtained favor the hypothesis that non-spatial conceptions are ultimately motivated by spatial ones. This in turn, shows the language-specific character of parameterization due to the clear differences that exist between the English prepositions between, among, and amid, and their Spanish equivalent entre. The cognitive linguistic analysis showed in this research may also offer a new perspective in the area of Language Teaching. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research on the plausibility of psycholinguistic validation and pedagogical applications of the conceptual bases proposed."

106553,1991,accounting review,auditor credibility and initial public offerings,auditor credibility and initial public offerings,"Abstract This study tests for a relationship between auditor reputation and underwriting fees incurred by foreign companies making an initial public offering (IPO) of equity securities in the United States during the years 1984 through 1991. The study also seeks to determine whether the companies tended to switch to internationally known auditors prior to the offering. Previous research has reported that domestic issuers incurred a smaller underwriting commission if they retained a Big Six or Big Eight audit firm when making an IPO, and that among those companies making auditor changes, there was a clear preference for the internationally known audit firms. A regression analysis indicates that. after controlling for ex ante uncertainty, economies of scale, and underwriter class, the marginal effect of auditor reputation on underwriting fees incurred by foreign companies making an IPO in the United States is not significant. Thus, the results in this paper contrast with the evidence in previous research revealing a negative association between auditor reputation and IPO underwriting fees. On the other hand, the percentage of foreign companies switching auditors just prior to going public was slightly higher than in the previous research on domestic companies. Collapse"

106556,1991,accounting review,british entrepreneurs and pre-industrial revolution evidence of cost management,british entrepreneurs and pre industrial revolution evidence of cost management,"ccounting histories have dated the advent of sophisticated cost management from the mid-1880s (Solomons 1952). The scientific management movement is credited with instituting and popularizing cost management techniques. However, it might be suspected that British en- trepreneurs of the Industrial Revolution would have developed sophisti- cated costing techniques earlier, given their significant methodological ad- vances in other economic areas. This article reports the findings from surviving business records of 25 sizeable British industrial firms (mostly in the iron and textile industries) from 1760 to 1850. Substantial evidence of a relatively mature cost man- agement has been found in four major areas of activity: cost control tech- niques, accounting for overhead, costing for routine and special decision making, and standard costing. Speculations about the motivations for cost management and about specific factors influencing the iron and textile industries are considered. Because the accounting practices of these firms predated the genesis of ""the costing renaissance"" a century later, our un- derstanding of cost management practices in the Industrial Revolution is augmented by the survey.

Thus by comparing analyst earnings forecasts to stock prices, a test can gauge analyst rationality and market efficiency. My research is based on this premise. Following Abarbanell (1991) and Lys and Sohn (1990), this paper will extend research on analyst rationality by examining how analysts revise their opinions as stock prices change. I use two sample groups consisting of quarterly earnings forecasts from 1996 to 2001, a Dow sample and an Internet sample. Analyst earnings revisions are regressed on stock and market returns since an analyst’s previous forecast, calculating “forecast response coefficients.” The Dow forecast response coefficients are positive and significant in all years and show that forecasts do move in the same direction as stock prices. However, the Internet sample forecast response coefficient is only significant in two years, moving from 1.089 in 1998 to –0.505 in 1999. Second, I run a regression of forecast error on stock and market returns for three time periods: before, during, and after the forecast announcement. The results show that analysts do not fully incorporate information available in prices in each group, so errors can be predicted based on price movements prior to an analyst’s forecast revision announcement. I find that while both Dow and Internet analyst revisions stray from informative prices, the largest departure occurred in the Internet group in 1999. Overall, evidence indicate that analysts and prices are rational at times and irrational at times, a puzzle that should motivate future research. Collapse"
106560,1991,american economic review,the mathematization of economic theory,the mathematization of economic theory,"Many economists show certain nonconformity relative to the excessive mathematical formalization of economics. This stems from dissatisfaction with the old debate about the lack of correspondence between mainstream theoretical models and reality. Although we do not propose to settle this debate here, this article seeks to associate the mismatch of mathematized models with the reality of the adoption of the hypothetical-deductive method as reproduced by general equilibrium. We begin by defining the main benefits of the mathematization of economics. Secondly, we address traditional criticism leveled against it. We then focus on more recent criticism from Gillies (2005) and Bresser-Pereira (2008). Finally, we attempt to associate the reproduction of the hypothetical-deductive method with a metatheoretical process triggered by Debreu's general equilibrium theory. In this respect, we appropriate the ideas of Weintraub (2002), Punzo (1991), and mainly Woo (1986) to support our hypothesis. Collapse"

106576,1991,american economic review,savings and wealth in models with altruistic bequests,savings and wealth in models with altruistic bequests,"During recent years much attention has been given to the role of bequests in explaining various aspects of economic behavior. For example, authors have studied the impact of bequests on physical wealth accumulation (Laurence Kotlikoff and Lawrence Summers, 1981), the interest elasticity of savings (Owen Evans, 1983), tax reform (Laurence Seidman, 1984), and the distribution of wealth (Alan Blinder, 1976a). More recently, economists have begun to distinguish between human and physical bequests (Gary Becker and Nigel Tomes, 1986). Acknowledging the presence of bequest in human form is important in analyzing each of the issues mentioned above. Outlays on children affect the shape of the family's labor supply and expenditure profiles, upon which the level of aggregate savings crucially depends. If these outlays are interest-sensitive substitutes for physical bequests, they will also influence the interest elasticity of savings. In the area of tax reform, the neutrality of the consumption tax depends on the ability of the government to identify human capital bequests from general consumption (Raymond Batina, 1987). If this is not possible, the ""portfolio-choice"" of investment in human versus physical capital may be distorted at the margin. Finally, the unequal transmission of wealth across generations may be explained by the lack of physical bequests and the inefficiently low levels of human bequests made by wealthconstrained households (Becker and Tomes, 1986). To distinguish clearly the behavior of constrained households from unconstrained households, who make sizeable physical bequests, both types of bequests must be recognized.' This paper introduces a model that makes explicit examination of these issues possible. It extends Lord's (1989) multiperiod model of life-cycle savings and adult human capital investment by adding altruistically motivated human and physical bequests.2 The model is calibrated using microeconomic data on earnings, time and goods expenditures on children's human capital, and physical bequests. We then use the model to examine the contribution of bequests to wealth accumulation and the level of savings. This topic is the source of an important but yet unresolved debate between Franco Modigliani (1988) and Kotlikoff (1988). Kotlikoff maintains that U.S. wealth accumulation is primarily the consequence of bequests, as opposed to life-cycle savings for retirement. One type of evidence cited by Kotlikoff comes from simulation results demonstrating the failure of realistically calibrated life-cycle models to generate sufficiently high saving rates and wealth:income ratios (Alan Auerbach and Kotlikoff, 1987). We show, however, that if a pure life-cycle Collapse"

106580,1991,american economic review,are workers permanently scarred by job displacements?,are workers permanently scarred by job displacements,"This paper investigates whether workers suffer lasting ""scars"" following job displacements. Using David T. Ellwood's (1982) terminology, ""scars"" represent persistent effects, whereas ""blemishes"" are transitory adjustments which dissipate over time. More precisely, dislocated individuals are defined as scarred if they continue to earn less or to be unemployed more than their nondisplaced counterparts, even after the conclusion of a several-year adjustment period. Article: Displacements may have a transitory impact if workers initially obtain unstable positions but later move to more secure jobs or if low wages are received during short- lasting probationary or training periods. These temporary effects, although important, cause less concern than persistent scarring. It is therefore somewhat surprising that, despite the proliferation of recent research studying the consequences of permanent layoffs, relatively little is known about the duration of the associated adjustment problems. 1 Data for this study were obtained for heads of households from the 1969-1982 waves (survey reporting years) of the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Displacement status was ascertained for the five base years 1971-1975, with respondents defined as permanently displaced if they terminated jobs as the result of plant closings or layoffs (excluding departures from temporary or seasonal jobs) and failed to return to the original employer by the end of the second full calendar year following the layoff. Data were collected on unemployment and weekly wages for the three years preceding and four years following the base period. The base year is hereafter referred to as time t, the following four years are referred to as periods t + 1 through t + 4, and numbers subtracted from t refer to periods preceding the base year. Information was also assembled indicating whether respondents were displaced in year t + 5. Collapse"

Irving B. Kravis, Alan W. Heston, and Robert Summers (1982), for example, report that some countries' national price levels are no more than one-third the U.S. price level. Extensions of this work show that such departures from PPP have persisted for decades. Recently, efforts have been made to explain systematically these persistent, or structural, departures from PPP. Pioneering work by Kravis and Robert E. Lipsey (1983, 1987, 1988) has demonstrated that a positive correlation between the price level and (real) per capita gross domestic product is robust across numerous cross-sectional specifications. For instance, using data from Kravis et al.

106582,1991,american economic review,the winner's curse:  experiments with buyers and with sellers,the winners curse experiments with buyers and with sellers,"This paper explores the winner's curse phenomena as it was studied experimentally by Kagel and Levin. Experiments with the winner's curse are complicated by the fact that subjects can lose money and the experimenter has only a limited means of collecting it from them. Thus subjects enjoy only limited liability which has theoretical implications for behavior. In the Kagel and Levin experiments subjects were removed from the bidders' competition after losses reached a predetermined value. This experimental procedure has unknown implications for the results so ambiguity exists about whether the winner's curse was actually observed. In this study their results were replicated in an environment in which subjects were not removed. The case in which competitors are sellers is also studied. Bankruptcy cannot be a problem in sellers' competition. In both cases the winner's curse is observed. Thus the limited liability cannot be an explanation for the phenomenon reported by Kagel and Levin. In addition the paper examines the bidding behavior of all individuals and shows that this behavior does not fit any of the tested theories either on the aggregate or individual level. The ""winner's curse"" did not disappear over time during the conduct of the research. Collapse"

In particular (i) the housing services provided by owner-occupied housing (generally referred to as imputed rents) are untaxed and (ii) mortgage interest payments reduce taxable income. The potential economic distortions resulting from the unique treatment of housing may be substantial, especially in light of the fact that residential capital accounts for more than half of the assets in the U.S. In particular, this tax treatment distorts the households' portfolio composition, their saving rates and their tenure choice. In this paper we build a general equilibrium model populated by heterogeneous agents subject to idiosyncratic risk. We use this framework to quantitatively assess the macroeconomic and distributional distortions introduced by this preferential tax treatment.

This substantial expenditure, together with the huge technological scale of EOS (it will consist of large orbital platforms each carrying a multitude of sensors), have promoted considerable debate and alternative proposals for smaller-scale, modular spacecraft each carrying one or a few sensors. Proponents of the alternatives hold that the smaller-scale approach, in addition to being less expensive, foregoes few scale economies and avoids the ""eggs-in-one-basket"" risk of EOS, in which failure in launching a spacecraft or failure of one instrument on a multi-instrument spacecraft causes failure of the whole system. Advocates of EOS are concerned that the small-scale approach not only fails to exploit scale economies but may yield much lower information content, claiming that significant economies of scope are obtainable in operating and taking measurements from sensors aggregated on large spacecraft. In this paper we first ask whether scale and scope economies appear substantial enough, and risk small enough, to justify the large-scale approach presently envisioned.2 We then ask two separate but related questions about the organization of the project, namely whether these supply attributes require the technology to be an almost exclusively governmental activity. A dearth of information about remote sensing economics forces our approach to the production technology to be heuristic rather than empirical. Subject to this constraint, we fail to find evidence of significant scale and scope effects in large spacecraft and sensor manufacturing and launch, even after taking account of risk differentials among largerscale and smaller-scale systems (the former tDiscussants: Arthur DeVany, University of California-Irvine; Nancy Rose, MIT; James Dearden, Lehigh University.

California voters approved Proposition 103 in 1988; it requires that all rates be approved by the state insurance commissioner, attempts to reduce rates by 20 percent, and dramatically limits the criteria that can be used to rate drivers for premium purposes. New Jersey enacted an insurance reform law that seeks to charge insurers for a deficit-burdened state underwriting pool and prohibits the use of age, sex, and marital status in rating drivers for premiums. Other states enacting or considering significant rate rollbacks or reform since 1988 include Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. This article describes the current consequences of similar policies adopted in Massachusetts more than a decade ago. The experience suggests that recent moves by other states in the same direction will ultimately prove quite expensive as the proportion of high-cost drivers increases and as insurers lose the incentive to write policies and control costs. The trend away from insurance premiums based on expected cost also reduces incentive effects for drivers, since insurance premiums provide a link between tort judgments and consumer decisions.

Using a series of phenomenological interviews in our exploration of the main constituencies in successful message development and delivery, namely the creative producers, the message developers, and the target audience, we acknowledge the contributions of Cultural Studies theory (Hall 1993) and to a lesser extent the Political Economy of Media (Schiller 1995). Summary According to UNAIDS, in 2003 approximately 38 million people globally were estimated to be living with HIV and nearly 3 million died from the disease (www.unaids.org). In fact 95% of the people living with HIV/AIDS are in the developing world with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries suffering the most. Although awareness and knowledge of AIDS levels are steadily increasing among targeted populations, the spread of AIDS in these countries continues to rise at alarming rates. In response to repeated calls for transformative research and to the moral mandate for a compassionate response to the world?s AIDS crisis, this paper?on an admittedly micro level?investigates the impact of culture and government in mediated communications about HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention in the Caribbean (Rothschild and Anderson 1998; Nowak and Siska 1995; Hill 1993; Mody 1991). Negotiating the challenges of this sensitive topic, which include stigma, conflicting cultural ideals, and politically-charged resource constraints, requires a systematic stream of research. Using a series of phenomenological interviews in our exploration of the main constituencies in successful message development and delivery, namely the creative producers, the message developers, and the target audience, we acknowledge the contributions of Cultural Studies theory (Hall 1993) and to a lesser extent the Political Economy of Media (Schiller 1995). This study focuses on the perspective of the producer of the messages (i.e., creative personnel). Conceptualization Cultural Studies theory?s most applicable assertion in the context of this study is its challenge to the linear ?sender-message-receiver? pattern of traditional communication theory. According to Hall (1993), there are several complex relationships within each step of the communication process and they are often iterative and vulnerable to what is termed that ?oppositional readings? where the intended 476 / WORKING PAPERS meaning of the message is lost or misinterpreted. As a result the audience is empowered and can now be seen as active participants in the communication process. This concept of audience participation is not new to the marketing literature and has been addressed in terms of message comprehension (Burnkrant and Unnava 1995; Greenwald and Leavitt 1984), ascribing meaning (McQuarrie and Mick 1992, Mittal 2002; Thompson, Pollio and Locander 1994), and experiential consumption (Arnould and Price 1993; Bitner 1992) among other concepts. Additionally, Cultural Studies theory holds that in the course of communication another series of relationships determine what is produced and how it is produced. It is this aspect of the process that is the focus of this particular endeavor?the relationship between the message producers (i.e., advertising agencies and creative shops) and the message developers (i.e., government and community-based organizations). The cultural background of the message designers themselves is significant as the collective experiences of the message designer may help or hurt the message production process. For example, a message producer who belongs to the same cultural background of the audience ?...may be more knowledgeable about their problems, but may share their caste and class prejudices...? (Mody 1991, 105). Those prejudices may very well be the ones which contributed to adverse conditions for the audience?conditions which the communication campaign may be designed to reverse or eradicate (e.g., HIV/AID stigma). As Johar, Holbrook and Stern (2001) have duly noted, creativity is appreciated in the marketing discipline, but rarely studied. Much of the literature surrounding the creative aspect of advertising revolves around consumers? response to various forms (Stewart and Koslow 1989; McQuarrie and Mick 1992; Clow, Roy, and Hershey 2001), the interpersonal relationships among agency personnel and between client and agency (Thompson and Haytko 1997), or the motivational perspectives of a career in art direction or copywriting (Kover, James, and Sonner 1997; Young 2000). The call for scholars and practitioners to think more about the ?creative spark, which drives much of advertising? remains virtually unanswered (Zinkham 1995). Consequently, it behooves marketers to gain a richer understanding of the lived experience of the creative personnel who bring these messages to fulfillment. Method The proposed study will take place in May 2006 and is in response to an initial round of research by a native graduate student, which dealt with three key issues: 1) assessing the baseline knowledge of key HIV/AIDS issues among the producers and recipients of the message, 2) determining the degree of experiential overlap between these two groups, and 3) gauging the effectiveness of message communication. It considered three main constituencies: 1) the producers and developers of the work (via 11 interviews), 2) the target audience (via a five-person focus group), and 3) the crafted messages themselves (via content analysis of 17 posters). No formal hypotheses were submitted. All activity took place between January and June 2003; however the communication artifacts were used island-wide between 1999 and 2003. The results showed there was acceptable baseline knowledge of key HIV/AIDS issues among the producers and selected recipients of the message; however the degree of experiential overlap between these two groups was ambiguous as target audience participation was decidedly problematic. In a similar vein, the lack of a structured research instrument made the task of evaluating messages effectiveness difficult to ascertain. Before developing a subsequent round of research to address the gaps in the preliminary study and collect more statistically compelling data, the study has been reduced into smaller segments, the first being conversations with the producers. Participants will be asked to describe the events that led up to involvement with this project per the guidelines put forth in Thompson, Locander, and Pollio (1990) for phenomenological interviewing. Interviews will be conversational in nature with the interviewee leading the exchange (both researchers will be present whenever feasible and appropriate). Rather than include explicit inquiry about the professional relationship with non-profits and public sector organizations or the impact of cultural heritage on their work, those lessons are expected to emerge from the data. The interview transcripts will be revisited using a deliberately iterative interpretative approach (Thompson 1997). Current research objectives revolve around gaining a richer understanding of the following areas of inquiry 1) each participant?s personal journey in their career, 2) the knowledge of key HIV/AIDS issues among the producers, and 3) the process of negotiating form and content of the HIV/AIDS production project. This should help to develop a more theoretical understanding of the process used in message production and uncover any latent patterns in both the content and construction of the mediated communication. Two frameworks will likely guide the retrieval of meaning from these narrative accounts. The first is the Social Adaptation of Thompson?s Hermeneutic Framework, which includes the following constructs: 1) perception of benefits; 2) consumer resistance; 3) countervailing consequences; and 4) countervailing socio-cultural forces (Rothschild and Andreasen 1998). The second is the UNAIDS/ Penn State framework, which affirms five inter-related, behavior-shaping contextual domains?government policy, socio-economic status, culture, gender relations and spirituality (Airhihenbuwa, Bunmi, and Obregon 1999). Findings/Implications Preliminary findings from the first study suggest a possible relationship between ?consumer resistance? (from the Thompson framework) and ?gender relations? (from UNAIDS/Penn State framework), which may help explain, for example, why messages that feature a woman purchasing condoms lack credibility within the Caribbean context. Other issues such as the use of Jamaican patois (a national dialect of broken English), the challenge to solicit the insight of political influencers without obligation to physically represent them in posters, and the need to honor both legislative and cultural restrictions on the type of information shared (e.g., fear appeals or heavily rational, numbers-driven tactics are discouraged and likely will not be funded), exemplify the intersection of theory and practice within a social marketing context and offer tactical routes to improving message effectiveness. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that a richer understanding of the producer?s perspective will further illuminate the meaning of the preliminary findings.

Questionnaires were sent randomly to 100 managers of national, state, and local parks; 43 usable questionnaires were returned. Results of the survey indicated that almost 40 percent of the managers surveyed used some type of regulation in the management of climbing. Managers perceived climbing to be no different than other recreational activities with regard to the distribution and severity of environmental impact. Less than 89% of the areas studied had any record of visitor conflict involving climbers. Only 16.3% of the managers agreed that their staff is well trained to handle climbing accidents. Results indicated that 85.7% of the agencies who believed they were well trained to handle accidents regulated climbing while only 41.2% of the agencies who believed they wele not well trained regulated climbing. While most managers were concerned with the search and rescue issues, they were not unduly alarmed about the possible legal outcomes of climbing. Over 67% of the managers believed that the climbers should pay for the cost of their own rescue. Decisions about whether or not to regulate climbing appeared to be based on liability and search-and-rescue related concerns rather than on concerns about environmental impacts or visitor conflicts.

Managers were asked to compare the use of regulations for climbing to other outdoor recreation activities from the perspective of three major areas: (a) environmental impacts, (b) potential for visitor conflicts, and (c) issues related to legal liability and search and rescue opwations. With the exception of issues related to search and rescue operations, it appeared that managers were no more likely to regulate climbing than they were to regulate other outdoor recreational activities. Possible strategies for mitigating regulation and/or prohibition of climbing were presented. Introduction Wii'xin recent years there has been a tremendous increase in outdoor adventure recreation participation (Ewert, 1987; Jensen, 1985). Such aztivities include backpacking, hang-gliding, mountaineering, nordic skiing, and spelunking just to na-,ie a few. Possible explanations for this increase in popularity include sociolocal and personal psychological benefits. People frequently engage in recreational activities to develop a feeling of belonging to a group or class of people. Many clubs are associated with outdoor adventure activities and thus provide the potential for sociological benefits (Jensen, 1985). Participants frequently indicate the need for new experiences, excitement, and challenge as reasons for participating in outdoor adventure activities. (Jensen, 1985). Because of the tremendous resource requirements associated with outdoor adventure activities, most participants look to government agencies (particularly state and federal) to provide areas for adventure recreation. The demand for such recreation has presented managers with three major problems. First, high levels of recreational use can produce severe environmental impazts such as: the deterioration of ground vegetation, the compaction and erosion of soil, stress on wildlife populations, and deterioration of water quality. Second, conflicts can occur between individuals participating in the same recreational wtivity or in different activities because they are competing to use the same resource. Finally, because of the element of risk associated with adventure activities, managers are occasionally confronted with problems related to legal liability and the need for search and rescue operations. Perhaps because of these problems, several areas have begun to limit participation in climbing and in some cases prohibited participation in the activity entirely. The purpose of this study was to examine park managers attitudes toward the high adventure activity climbing. Climbing was selected because (a) it has a long history of participation in the United States, (b) it can occur in many different climates and environments thus ensuring national appeal, and (c) because of its long history, many recreation area managers would be familiar with it as opposed to some of the newer adventure activities. Specifically, this study examined managers' perceptions regarding the activity of Collapse"

Even local dissidents were stunned by the sudden turn of events. We will never know how many East Europeans did foresee the explosion of 1989. But at each step, accounts painted a picture of nations united in amazement. To my knowledge, only one study addresses the issue systematically. Four months after the breaching of the Berlin Wall, the Allensbach Institute asked a broad sample of East Germans: ""A year ago did you expect such a peaceful revolution?"" Only 5 percent answered ""yes,"" though 18 percent responded ""yes, but not that fast."" Fully 76 percent admitted to being totally surprised. These figures are all the more remarkable given the I-knew-it-would-happen fallacy-the human tendency to exaggerate foreknowledge (Baruch Fischhoff and Ruth Beyth, 1975). Yet in hindsight the revolution appears as inevitable. In each of the six countries the leadership was despised, economic promises remained unfulfilled, and basic freedoms existed only on paper. More importantly, winds of change in the Soviet Union were making Soviet intervention increasingly unlikely. But if the revolution was indeed inevitable, why was it not foreseen?

Some have argued that such limits would be costless, but our analysis suggests that there is no free lunch. (See our forthcoming paper.) We have attempted to estimate the costs but not the global benefits of slowing down climate change through carbon limitations. All computations were performed in parallel for five geopolitical regions. Except for oil trade, these regions were treated independently-as though there were no opportunity for international trade in carbon rights. For stimulating ideas on the politics and economics of negotiating an agreement on greenhouse gas emission permits, see M. Grubb (1989). Whatever rule is adopted for the allocation of carbon emission rights, there are likely to be significant interregional differences in the value of these rights. International trade will be needed if economic efficiency is to be achieved. In the absence of such trade, there are likely to be significant distortions in the comparative advantage of individual locations for the production of tradeable basic materials such as primary metals. These distortions could lead to counterproductive regulations and new forms of nontariff barriers to trade. This paper is intended to quantify the potential for international trade in carbon emission rights. Collapse"
106614,1991,aer pandp,towards a comprehensive approach to global climate change mitigation,towards a comprehensive approach to global climate change mitigation,"Global climate change, its present control and even its future reduction have been considered. Energy has been proposed as the main feed of comprehensive development. The way for meeting energy needs which certainly affects the existing energy resources will have forceful climate consequences. The purpose of this study is to explore how, in practice, the energy requirements of sustainable development can be afforded without any climate-change aggravation. Two fundamental approaches were proposed and completely discussed: the first long-term developing approach is the use of advanced energy-productive technologies instead of the existing ones and/or implementation of hybrid processes, a combination of conventional systems with a newly low energy-consumptive and emission-reductive technology in a newly installed system. The second most sustainable scheme is the development of alternative renewable energy (RE) resources. In this case, available internationally legal documents discovering the RE policies were explored and their commitment strategies were taken into original and deliberate challenges. It was concluded that the best solution to afford energy requirements is the expansion of RE sources, excluding or rarely without any sanctions reflected on the main documents of international climate policy. Since the dominant conditions of international investments have more tendencies to the short-time cost-efficient methods, the documents have only provided a limited situation for the expansion of REs. As a result, the present weak status of REs in the documents comprises their attitude towards the long-term developing scheme (the first approach) and not to the most sustainable scheme of altering the energy resources (the second approach).

Robert Hall (1982) has estimated that the first 10 years of an individual's working career will include approximately two-thirds of all lifetime job changes. Robert Topel and Michael Ward (1988) found that over half of young male new entrants held six or more jobs over the first 10 years of their work experience. Only one young male worker in twenty held a single job for 10 years in their sample. All of this suggests that young workers' early years in the labor market involve several employment transitions. The purpose of this paper is to examine for young workers in their first years of work the determinants of leaving an employer. In particular, this paper focuses on the role of different types of training on the probability of leaving an employer. In previous work (1990) I have examined the impact of private-sector training on the determination of wages and wage growth of young workers and reached the following conclusions. First, formal company-provided onthe-job training (ON-JT) appears to be highly firm-specific in the United States and, therefore, is not portable from employer to employer. Company-provided training raises wages in the current job but has no effect on the wages earned in subsequent employment. Second, formal off-the-job training (OFF-JT) received from ""for-profit"" proprietary institutions has little effect on the wages earned on the current job, but it does raise the expected wage in subsequent employment. Finally, there are important differences by race, gender, and education level in the probability of receiving different types of formal training and in the impact this training has on wages and wage growth. These findings have several implications for the impact of training on mobility. One implication is that if company-provided training is primarily firm-specific, then the probability of leaving an employer should decline if a young worker has experienced some ON-JT. An additional implication is that if a worker participates in an OFF-JT program, it appears that the worker should be more likely to leave the current employer. In this case, OFF-JT allows a young worker to change career paths and find a ""better match."" Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey Youth (NLSY) cohort, this paper examines in detail the factors that influence the probability of new entrants leaving their first job, including the differential effects of company-provided training, apprenticeships, and training from for-profit proprietary institutions.

106618,1991,aer pandp,gender differences in labor market effects of alcoholism,gender differences in labor market effects of alcoholism,"Little is known about the role of specific health problems in affecting labor market productivity. Even less is known about gender differences in the labor market effects of such health problems. Current knowledge of health effects is based largely on samples composed exclusively of men, a common practice in both economics and health research. In the latter case, even a congressional mandate to incorporate females in study samples is reputed to have had little effect (Patricia Schroeder, 1990). In this study, we attempt to determine the structure of gender differences in labor market responses to alcoholism. We use a relatively new data source that allows such comparisons by gender in a large community-based sample. Previous studies have established that there are significant gender differences in labor market behavior. Differences in prevalence rates of alcoholism by gender are also well established. It is estimated that 3 percent of females are currently suffering from alcoholism and twice that many have exhibited symptoms at some time; for males the numbers are 10 and 20 percent, respectively. There is some medical evidence to indicate that physiologically, women and men respond differently to alcohol. For example, a recent study suggests that women have greater vulnerability to the acute and chronic health conditions associated with alcoholism (Mario Frezza et al., 1990). Collapse"
106619,1991,aer pandp,europe post-1992:  internal and external liberalization,europe post 1992   internal and external liberalization,"INTRODUCTION: INSIDE - OUTSIDE Whereas other aspects of the transition towards democracy (and market economies) are studied quite extensively (and although there has been a gradual change in this regard in the mid-1980s), the international dimension of this process is still an under-researched area; when it comes to comparative and quantitative research it is even largely left out. This situation is rather paradoxical in view of ""the salience of international factors in this process"" (Pridham/ Herring/Sanford 1994: 2) and the observation that democracy ""does not happen in an international vacuum"" (Di Palma 1990: 183). This paradox is due to the intrinsic complexity of international relations and the wide range of external factors which make it difficult to assess the influence and importance of external factors and to establish unequivocal causal relationships (Pridham 1994: 11). A glimpse at the empirical reality shows the variety and the magnitude of external factors: (A) In both the Federal Republic of Germany and Japan international politics was at the beginning of democratization. Here, one can think of the military defeat in World War II and the determination of the victorious and democratic countries, foremost the United States of America, to create and substantially support democratic political systems and governments in these countries in the face of the emerging antagonism vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. Alfred Stepan (1986: 71f.) coined the term externally monitored installation to describe these events. (B) Taiwan and South Korea are countries in which democratization can--at least partly--be attributed to the direct and indirect effects of an export-oriented strategy of development. This strategy involved a thorough integration into the world market. As a result, the number of the political and economic elite's as well as the urban population's external contacts with democracies markedly increased (university exchange programs, studies in foreign countries, business and trade relations, cultural exchange). These contacts provided the basis for a growing realization that membership in the club of western industrialized countries (the OECD) would be facilitated by the liberalization and the democratization of one's own political system (Diamond 1992: 121). (C) In the case of the democratic transitions and consolidations in Southern Europe, the regional structure was conducive to and promoted democratization. The European Community required democratic political systems as a ticket to EC membership; Brussels not only provided economic incentives, but, at times, also resorted to political pressure to initiate democratic reforms. (The ""freezing"" of the Greek application for membership after the military takeover in 1967 is a case in point.) Once a member of the EC, this membership furthered the democratic consolidation in Greece, Portugal and Spain (Pridham 1991). (D) By contrast, at times, the regional structure and, particularly, the policies of the United States, the hegemonic power, were adverse to democratization in a number of Latin American countries. Under the impact of the east-west-conflict and the global system confrontation with the USSR, Washington often perceived democratic mass movements in Latin America as potential or likely intrusion targets for communist action. To prevent the domino theory to become true, the US conducted various secret service operations, e.g. in Guatemala 1954, in Brazil 1964, in Chile 1973 and in Nicaragua 1984 (Forsythe 1992). In turn, after the end of the east-west-conflict, there is greater political space for democratic mass movements (Karl 1990: 15f.). It is obvious from these cases that it is very difficult to translate the international dimension into hard empirical data and variables; since he could not identify a ""reliable empirical indicator for that purpose,"" Tatu Vanhanen (1997: 161), for example, was persuaded to leave out an analysis of the significance of external factors and power resources in his recent study on the perspective of democracy in more than 170 states. … Collapse"
106620,1991,aer pandp,the challenges of german unification for ec policymaking and performance,the challenges of german unification for ec policymaking and performance,"Rarely have economists been treated to an economic ""experiment"" comparable to the one of German reunification. In less than a year, a single political and economic entity is being fused from two economies with fundamentally different underlying principles of economic organization and substantially different levels of economic development. (See Horst Siebert, 1990, and David Begg et al., 1990.) Nonetheless, major regional disparities between western and eastern Germany (what were the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and German Democratic Republic (GDR)) will undoubtedly continue for many years. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, both German Monetary Union (GMU) and political reunification were realized on July 1 and October 3, 1990, respectively. In this process, the advice of economists was often ignored in favor of political imperatives (see Roland Vaubel, 1990). Concerned with the potential impact of German Economic and Monetary Union (GEMU) on the process of European economic and political integration, many European Community (EC) policymakers have perceived German reunification as adding impetus to the ""1992"" program. Nonetheless, such initial reactions to GEMU have generally been formulated with only fragmentary information regarding the subsequent economic costs and policy measures, necessitated by the real resource transfer in order to achieve the German government's stated objective of equalizing living standards between western and eastern Germany. To the extent that GEMU generates positive or negative spillover effects to other EC countries, it presents challenges that can potentially influence the speed and degree of European economic integration. This paper examines economic implications of GEMU for the European integration process. In so doing, it makes reference to the burgeoning literature on the economic consequences of German reunification. Consideration of statistical information related to the performance of eastern and western Germany since June 1990 permits some evaluation of the validity of certain hypotheses underlying earlier studies of GEMU, as well as an assessment of likely consequences for EC policymaking and performance. Nonetheless, it is contended that the most provocative implications of GEMU result from the specific case it provides for analyzing the costs involved in integrating the fundamentally different centrally planned economies (CPE) of Eastern Europe within a viable European ""economic space."" In this sense, the German reunification ""experiment"" offers not only the remarkable opportunity to measure the economic costs associated with the total reorganization and restructuring of a CPE to a free-market economy, but also to assess the contribution of government policy measures in this conversion process. Yet, certain unique characteristics of GEMU limit the validity of lessons from the German experience for understanding the adjustment processes in other Eastern European economies. Collapse"

Before World War II, Czechoslovakia was a democracy, with GNP per capita similar to that of Belgium and Austria. Its industries were on the technological edge and its products were known worldwide for their superb workmanship. By 1990, Czechoslovak GNP per capita is estimated by the World Bank at $3,300, thus being comparable to that of Venezuela, Gabon, and Yugoslavia, but only slightly above one-fifth of that of Austria and Belgium.1 Most Czechoslovak products are now of mediocre quality and selling at a discount, if at all, in the West. This remarkable transition occurred over approximately 40 years. During the postWorld War II reconstruction, the country was still run as a market economy, although major parts of industry, banking, and insurance were already nationalized. After the 1948 Communist takeover, Soviet-type economic planning was imposed, the remaining private enterprises were nationalized,2 and priority was given to heavy industry. Czechoslovak foreign trade was reoriented from world markets toward Soviet bloc countries. The Czechoslovak government adhered to the Soviet-type planning system faithfully throughout the 1950's. The economic slowdown in the early 1960's led to a series of reform attempts, that culminated during the Prague Spring of 1968 with a short-lived and partial program of price liberalization, separation of economic policy from political decision making, enterprise autonomy, and workers' participation in enterprise management. However, central planning was reimposed after the 1968 invasion and remained virtually intact until the late 1980's. Collapse"

106625,1991,aer pandp,the economic integration of post-wall germany,the economic integration of post wall germany,"Almost two years after the fall of the Berlin wall, Germany's Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT) is still struggling to merge R&D institutes in the unified nation. But while government officials pore over financing and integration schemes, many East German research groups are beginning to disintegrate. Tight money, cumbersome restructuring plans, questionable recruitment practices, and the politics of the Western industry and scientific communities are hampering the integration efforts. Experts now agree that the future for many East German research institutes is uncertain. Germany posted a deficit of DM66.4 billion ($40.5 billion) in 1991 due to the mammoth financial burden of promoting economic recovery in the five new federal states in eastern Germany. On top of financial constraints to prevent greater deficitary bloating, the resources of research minister Heinz Riesenhuber, who must foot much of the bill to remold the crumbling infrastructure of East German research, are already spread thin. Riesenhuber is a staunch supporter of space research. His involvement in the European Space Agency and various space projects, including the Ariane rocket system and the Hermes space shuttle, have almost absorbed the entire annual DM1.54 billion increase in his research budget this year. He is under more pressure than ever to reassess his priorities. The minister has negotiated a 9.7 percent increase in his 1992 budget to DM9.25 billion. He has agreed to contribute DM1.6 billion of the total to the new federal states. But, in the process, he has frozen funds for the large West German research centers, a move that could force them to cut several of their programs and block their own efforts to integrate East German R&D. Equally disturbing, state and federal officials agreed in September that the present scheme to finance the restructuring of R&D in eastern Germany was not working and must be changed. At the heart of the problem, they said, was the so-called ""blue list,"" a select group of research institutes that were to receive half their funds from the BMPT and the other half from state budgets. The scheme, widely used in western Germany to fund such research groups as the Fraunhofer Society, Max Planck Society and Heinrich Herz Institute, has failed in the east. The reason: unification costs have stretched the budgets of the new federal states to the limits. The states say they are DM63 million short of the money needed to meet their DM180 million share for the blue list institutes. To avoid a full collapse of East German research, the Bonn government has now agreed to add DM60 million to its two-year educational reform program for the blue list group. Consequently, the states are now expected to provide 35 percent instead of 50 percent of the funding for the institutes. However, some critics say the promised funds may come too late. Bias, Haste and Bureaucracy A number of scientists in the east charge that bias, haste and bureaucracy, coupled with efforts by West German industry and research bodies to exploit the situation, have grossly handicapped the integration process. Many say integration has already robbed eastern Germany of some of its best scientists and research teams. The problem stems from Germany's unification treaty, which dissolved the Soviet-inspired Academy of Sciences in East Germany. The treaty called for a government assessment of East German research and a plan to restructure it. The task fell to the Science Council, a federal science policy advisory body, based in Cologne. In July, the Cologne group completed--at a cost of DM3 million--a comprehensive survey of the academy's 130 non-university institutional offshoots. It concluded that less than half of the institutes--primarily those with complementary programs to institutes in the West or with research in new areas--should be maintained. These included scientific centers with basic research in physics, medicine and photonics. ? Collapse"

Moreover, differences in preferences or beliefs do not result in disagreement among shareholders about firm policies. Underlying this unanimity is the shared valuation of the stock, which translates into agreement about firm strategies. The ability to transact without affecting the market price is central to many important propositions, including the ModiglianiMiller irrelevance theorems. This paper examines the nature of supply curves for corporate equity. Until recently there has been little direct empirical assessment of their elasticity. At issue is whether or not the supposition of shareholder homogeneity of valuations (and its implications) represents a good approximation to actual markets. This paper's call for further empirical evaluation of shareholder valuations echoes the perspective offered by Eugene Fama and Merton Miller, who in discussing perfect markets observed that Collapse"

In spite of this, most investors hold nearly all of their wealth in domestic assets. In this paper, we construct new estimates of the international equity portfolio holdings of investors in the U.S., Japan, and Britain. More than 98% of the equity portfolio of Japanese investors is held domestically; the analogous percentages are 94% for the U.S., and 82% for Britain. We use a simple model of investor preferences and behavior to show that current portfolio patterns imply that investors in each nation expect returns in their domestic equity market to be several hundred basis points higher than returns in other markets. This lack of diversification appears to be the result of investor choices, rather than institutional constraints. Collapse"

106632,1991,aer pandp,the rationality struggle:  illustrations from financial markets,the rationality struggle illustrations from financial markets,"The May 2009-10 budget handed down by the Australian Federal Government aimed to manage 'the worst global recession since the Great Depression' (Taylor 2009). The budget reinforced the strategy that the relatively new Labor Government had begun the previous year to stimulate the economy and address the global financial crisis which has bitten deeply into the Australia economy and economies around the world. Similarly, other national governments have been struggling to manage their national economic destiny in the grip of the crisis. This state of affairs has catalysed reflection from left and right about the neoliberal approach to economic management and the appropriate role of markets. The Great Depression has been an important reference point for discussion about the current global financial crisis in two main respects. Firstly, the extent and breadth of the current crisis and how it might proceed has been compared to the Great Depression. While there have been other serious recessions, according to the International Monetary Fund, the world economy will suffer its worst year since the Great Depression (Wrought 2009). Projected increases in unemployment and reduced spending continue to erode business and consumer confidence and both employers and employees are at risk. However, the current crisis has been global in a stronger sense than the 1930s as it also involves emerging economies that have been incorporated into the global capitalist market. Secondly, like the Great Depression, there is a virtual policy vacuum within the canons of economic liberalism about how to respond. The Great Depression has shown that economies cannot count on the market to naturally rebound and post World War Il anti-recessionary policy has already been found to be flawed. In any case, a return to stronger market intervention which underpinned the Keynesian recessionary policies would have been antithetical to the prevailing direction of neoliberal economic reform prior to this recent and potentially devastating global recession (Pierson 1991, 141-165, Mishra 1990, 1-8). Neoliberal approaches to economic management began to dominate government agendas from the late 1970s onwards (Marginson 1997, 73-81). In the early 1970s, post-war enthusiasm for Keynesian macroeconomic management had begun to wane. It had not delivered guaranteed economic growth despite all its early promise, and had delivered both stagflation (simultaneous inflation and high unemployment) and social dissent over unanticipated post-material externalities. As the reinvigorated right gained political ascendancy, the belief in the efficacy of markets was strengthened although naive notions of markets as reified natural mechanisms, had been largely replaced by the recognition that market conditions had to be constructed (Harvey 2005, 1-5, 64-70). Governments of western nations embarked on microeconomic reform and at times radical policies to ensure that policy and civil society obstacles to a more marketised economy were overcome. Generally more so this occurred in English speaking countries than in Europe. At an international level, trade liberalisation strategies pursued by global financial institutions such as the World Trade Organisation, World Bank, and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, as well as numerous regional trade treaties, disciplined domestic economies towards participation in a global market comprising the relatively free flow of capital, goods and services (Mishra 1999, 5-12). For developing nations, economic aid was linked to compliance with the neoliberal economic agenda. Significantly, neoliberal economic strategy sought to place more prerogative into the hands of managers, investors and lenders, with the view that rational selfinterest should be allowed to prevail to achieve better economic decisions and outcomes for society (Harvey 2005, 64-70). The 1930s Great Depression had caught unprepared those governments adhering to classic economic liberalism, leaving political space for a new strategy that eventually emerged as Keynesianism. … Collapse"

By the law of the downward-sloping demand function, their consumption will rise. But by how much? According to conventional wisdom, the consumption of these illegal addictive substances is not responsive to price. However, conventional wisdom is contradicted by Becker and Murphy's (1988) theoretical model of rational addiction. The Becker-Murphy (B-M) analysis implies that addictive substances are likely to be quite responsive to price. In this paper, we summarize B-M's model of rational addiction and the empirical evidence in support of it. We use the theory and evidence to draw highly tentative inferences concerning the effects of legalization of currently banned substances on consumption in the aggregate and for selected groups in the population. Addictive behavior is usually assumed to involve both ""reinforcement"" and ""tolerance."" Reinforcement means that greater past consumption of addictive goods, such as drugs or cigarettes, increases the desire for present consumption. But tolerance cautions that the utility from a given amount of consumption is lower when past consumption is greater. These aspects of addictive behavior imply Collapse"

They do not study illegal drugs empirically in this and their related papers. A major data source is the annual survey of high school seniors (HSS), also known as ""Monitoring the Future."" This work is summarized in L. Johnston et al. (1988). They find a growing use of drugs (measured by monthly, annual, and lifetime prevalence) over time, and differences by region and sex. Cocaine use showed marked increases from 1976, though this levelled off from 1986 to 1987. They often rely on cross-tabs that leaves many variables uncontrolled and the results subject to omitted variable bias. J. Bachman et al. (1984) use ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions in which the drug use in the three years post-high school is related to various characteristics such as living arrangements. While an improvement over cross-tabs, OLS applied to categorical dependent variables yields inefficient estimates (see M. Nerlove and S. Press, 1973). Johnston et al. used follow-up surveys of a subsample drawn from each cohort. They find the use of some drugs decline at older ages, say 35, though they do not determine if the heavy users have died, dropped out of the sample, or have been rehabilitated.' The HSS's initial restriction to high school seniors removes about 30 percent of the population who drop out of high school perhaps because of taking drugs. Studies based on the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) sample of people 12 and older show some heavy drug use of people less than 17 years old. (See J. D. Miller et al., 1982, and NIDA, 1985.) Richard Clayton (1985) using the 1980 HSS presents univariate regressions that shows the frequency of use of cocaine is positively related to lifetime marijuana use and days out of school in the past month, but negatively related to high school grade point average. H. Abelson and Miller (1985), using the NIDA surveys covering 1974-82, show differences in the percentage using cocaine by education and race-for lifetime, 12 months, and last month measures.

Resolutions from that meeting were later approved by the 58th World Health Assembly in Geneva. Since then, many organisations, countries, and donors have been working to deliver on those recommendations. In November this year, an even broader group of ministers and other stakeholders will gather in Bamako, Mali, to assess progress and determine new priorities. The 2008 Global Ministerial Forum on Research for Health will provide a unique platform for ministers of health, science and technology, and social development to discuss research with global experts and stakeholders. Refl ecting this diversity, and the broad vision of research for health, the meeting is being co-organised by a partnership involving the Council on Health Research for Development (COHRED), Global Forum for Health Research, Government of Mali, UNESCO, World Bank, and WHO. On the road to Bamako 2008, it is appropriate to refl ect on where we have been, what progress we have made, and where we wish to go in the future. In 1990, the Commission on Health Research for Development noted that only 5% of global spending on health research went to problems aff ecting the poorest 93% of the world’s people, now known as the “10/90 gap”. The Commission recommended investment in essential national health research, inter national partnerships, and mechanisms to monitor progress, and noted that “research should not be limited to the health sector, but should also examine the health impact of development in other sectors and the socioeconomic determinants of health”. The Commission’s pivotal report was followed in 1993 by the World Bank’s World development report: investing in health, and by the establishment of COHRED to promote the conduct and use of essential health research in developing countries. In 1996, WHO’s Ad Hoc Committee on Health Research Relating to Future Intervention Options identifi ed best buys for investment, including research on maternal and child health, microbial threats, health systems, noncommunicable diseases, and injuries. The Global Forum for Health Research was created in 1998 to advocate for greater invest ments in health research to meet the needs of poor people. In 2000, the Global Forum’s annual meeting was co-convened with WHO and the World Bank in Bangkok, Thailand, subsumed under an International Conference on Health Research for Development, in which COHRED had a leading organisational role. Participants emphasised the strengthening of national health research systems as a key priority to reduce the 10/90 gap. 4 years after the Bangkok meeting, the Global Forum’s eighth annual meeting was held in Mexico City in parallel with the Ministerial Summit on Health Research organised by WHO. The two overlapping events focused on research to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Ministers attending the summit committed to three key priorities: health-systems research, securing public confi dence in research, and bridging the gap between knowledge and action. These developments might have helped to stimulate the recent explosion of innovative new ideas and initiatives in global health. In this context, two additional phenomena deserve mention. First, some innovative developing countries (IDCs) such as Brazil, China, India, and South Africa have become important producers of low-cost drugs and vaccines. Second, donors and developing countries have both begun, rightly, to embrace science and technology as key drivers of social and economic development. So what progress have we made? Overall, this is a story of both new resources and new challenges. Global investments in research and development for health have quadrupled since 1986 (fi gure), though Collapse"

Unlike other authoritarian regimes that were less ideologically oriented, the Communist Party claimed to embody the movement of history and emphasized the interdependence of political action and scientific development: historical discourse, and related disciplines such as ethnology or archaeology, came under powerful ideological pressure and were subjected to frequent outside meddling. From World War II until the death of Stalin in 1953, the historiographies of the USSR's various federal entities were subjected to abrupt changes. However, despite the domination of Zhdanovism, the national historiographies--at least in Central Asia--were able to retain an interpretation of history that valorized the titular nation. The research conducted in the different republics' academies of sciences can therefore be seen as one of the matrices that permitted the symbolic justification and appropriation of the state and its territory: in its choice of historical reference points, the resulting shared sentiment of national identity would never be called into question during the entire second half of the 20th century, not even after the fall of the USSR in 1991. Autochthonism as a political and narrative matrix for the identities of the Soviet peoples is a well-known subject. Terry Martin has shown how much the Soviet Union was built on the principle of ""positive discrimination"" toward minorities, who were granted cultural and linguistic rights according to their administrative status as union republics, autonomous regions, and so on. Francine Hirsch's work on the role of ethnologists and local elites in the construction of identity referents, as well as Ronald Suny's on primordialism in Soviet national identities and Yuri Slezkine's on ""ethnophilia"" in Soviet science, have shed new light on the tight bond between the political environment, the development of the social sciences, and the articulation of discourses on identity. (1) Those studies, however, are mainly concerned with the 1920s and 1930s. The war, the postwar era, and the post-Stalinist upheavals after the mid-1950s remain little known in their impact on Central Asia. Yet it was at just this time, after the large-scale violence of Stalinism had ended, that the elites in the union republics could achieve stability, benefit from greater autonomy in publishing, and take advantage of the institutionalization of the academies of sciences. Autochthonization took shape in the form both of people--through the preference given to the titular nationality in hiring decisions in the human sciences--and of ideas, with the creation of discourses to legitimize the new republican entities. The historiographic autochthonization of the 1940s-50s that I discuss was made possible when the ""archaeological patriotism"" available to each republic joined with the conceptualization of the principle of the ""ethnogenesis"" of eponymous peoples to anchor the notion that there existed an authentic connection among a people, its territory, and the state. This ethnogenetic discourse emerged within the specific context of the late 1930s and was advanced by historians, mainly Russians, who sought to apply in the Central Asian republics the autochthonist principles that had emerged in Russian history. Their discourse had its hour of glory in the last decade of the Stalin era and is considered even now as orthodoxy in the area of ethnogenesis. After a brief introduction on the specific political context of Zhdanovism, this article discusses the diffusion of the concept of ethnogenesis in Central Asia, the carriers of this discourse, and their social space--the republican academies of sciences--before concluding with a consideration of how certain meanings have shifted through the rewriting of history by more nationalist historians in Central Asian academia. … Collapse"

Previous studies of the labour market experience of male immigrants to Canada have uncovered two disturbing trends: declining entry earnings for successive new immigrant cohorts, and low assimilation rates. These findings suggest that many cohorts may never assimilate. The 1991 Census provides a first look at the immigrant cohorts arriving in the 1980's. These immigrants appear to avoid the plight of their predecessors; entry earnings have stopped falling, and those immigrants arriving between 198 1 and 1985 experienced a 17% assimilation rate. 1 am unable to explain this tumaround based on the observable characteristics recorded in the census dataIn Chapter III, I explore the economic impact of immigrants' presence within the Canadian labour market on the wages of native-born Canadians and earlier immigrants.

In this paper 1 estimate the impact of immigration on native wages using Canadian data, paying close attention to the important econometric issues, such as the potential endogeneity of immigrants' choice of location upon amival. The ""iabour market"" is defined by occupations. Two important innovations are the use of immigrant source-country charactenstics and immigrants' intended occupation at entry as instruments in predicting immigration flows to the labour market. My results consistently point to no evidence of adverse effects of immigrants on the labour market outcomes of native-born Canadians.

Hungary, it is believed, has taken a more gradual, time-consuming, less forced approach towards the same end. These perceived contrasts in strategy (""shock therapy"" vs. ""gradualism"") are keenly debated in policy reform circles throughout the region, both with respect to necessity as well as to feasibility. The conventional wisdom greatly simplifies the contrast between the two countries. Recent political developments in Hungary have generated a substantial acceleration of reform efforts. The Hungarian reform program now operates on as broad a front as the Polish program: abandonment of central controls, price liberalization, introduction of competition, privatization, financial and fiscal system modernization, development of social safety nets, legal, regulatory and institutional reform, and so on. It seeks a no less fundamental and far-reaching change. The perception of gradualism probably has more to do with the past 20 years of Hungarian experimentation with piecemeal modifications to the economic mechanism (Janos Kornai, 1986) than to the present reality. That past experience certainly suggests that without genuine political commitment to a market economy, and particularly to a broad-based system of private property rights, systemic reforms in formerly socialist economies will not succeed. Once these precepts are accepted, the specific agenda items for reform appear to take on the same character in all reforming economies. The pace and sequencing of economic and institutional changes are then dictated by initial starting conditions that differ greatly between countries (Stanley Fischer and Alan Gelb, 1990). Price liberalization and the dismantling of central coordination can be accomplished overnight; the establishment of new legal systems, privatization, the restructuring of enterprises, generating attitudinal and behavioral changes in populations, all perforce take much longer. As a result, it may be expected that the ambit for genuine choices on pace and sequencing on policy and institutional change will narrow over time and that the content of reforms in Hungary and Poland and other countries will increasingly resemble one another.

Specifically, it appears that: (1) if we add a constant to all values of an attribute, then that attribute becomes less important; (2) if we proportionately increase all values of an attribute, or if we change the sign of an attribute, from positive to negative, then that attribute becomes more important.

The question is how to model economic choices made under these limits. Where, between perfect rationality and its complete absence, are we to set the ""dial of rationality,"" and how do we build this dial setting in to our theoretical models? One approach to this problem is to lay down axioms or assumptions that suppose limits to economic agents' computational ability or memory, and investigate their consequences. This is useful, but it begs the question of how humans actually behave. A different approach (the one I suggest here) is to develop theoretical economic agents that act and choose in the way actual humans do. We could do this by representing agents as using parametrized decision algorithms, and choose and calibrate these algorithms so that the agents' behavior matches real human behavior observed in the same decision context. Theoretical models using these ""calibrated agents"" would then, we could claim, furnish predictions based on actual rather than idealized behavior. It is unlikely there exists some yet-to-bedefined decision algorithm, some ""model of man,"" that would represent human behavior in all economic problems-an algorithm whose parameters would constitute universal constants of human behavior. Different contexts of decision making in the economy call for different actions; and an algorithm calibrated to reproduce human learning in a search problem might differ from one that reproduces strategic-choice behavior. We would likely need a repertoire of calibrated algorithms to cover the various contexts that might arise. Nevertheless, for a particular context of decision making, calibrating theoretical behavior to match human behavior would allow us to ask questions that are not answerable at present under the assumption of either perfect rationality or idealized learning. We might want to know whether a given neoclassical model with human agents represented by ""calibrated agents"" will result in some standard asymptotic patterna rational-expectations equilibrium, say. We might ask whether agents calibrated to learn as humans do converge to some form of optimality, or interactively to a Nash equilibrium.' And we might want to study the speed of adaptation in a particular economic model with human agents represented by calibrated agents. What would it mean to calibrate an algorithm to ""reproduce"" human behavior?

106658,1991,aer pandp,artificial adaptive agents in economic theory,artificial adaptive agents in economic theory,"Economic analysis has largely avoided questions about the way in which economic agents make choices when confronted by a perpetually novel and evolving world. As a result, there are outstanding questions of great interest to economics in areas ranging from technological innovation to strategic learning in games. This is so, despite the importance of the questions, because standard tools and formal models are ill-tuned for answering such questions. However, recent advances in computer-based modeling techniques, and in the subdiscipline of artificial intelligence called machine learning, offer new possibilities. Artificial adaptive agents (AAA) can be defined and can be tested in a wide variety of artificial worlds that evolve over extended periods of time. The resulting complex adaptive systems can be examined both computationally and analytically, offering new ways of experimenting with and theorizing about adaptive economic agents. Many economic systems can be classified as complex adaptive systems. Such a system is complex in a special sense: (i) It consists of a network of interacting agents (processes, elements); (ii) it exhibits a dynamic, aggregate behavior that emerges from the individual activities of the agents; and (iii) its aggregate behavior can be described without a detailed knowledge of the behavior of the individual agents. An agent in such a system is adaptive if it satisfies an additional pair of criteria: the actions of the agent in its environment can be assigned a value (performance, utility, payoff, fitness, or the like); and the agent behaves so as to increase this value over time. A complex adaptive system, then, is a complex system containing adaptive agents, networked so that the environment of each adaptive agent includes other agents in the system. Complex adaptive systems usually operate far from a global optimum or attractor. Such systems exhibit many levels of aggregation, organization, and interaction, each level having its own time scale and characteristic behavior. Any given level can usually be described in terms of local niches that can be exploited by particular adaptations. The niches are various, so it is rare that any given agent can exploit all of them, as rare as finding a universal competitor in a tropical forest. Moreover, niches are continually created by new adaptations. It is because of this ongoing evolution of the niches, and the perpetual novelty that results, that the system operates far from any global attractor. Improvements are always possible and, indeed, occur regularly. The everexpanding range of technologies and products in an economy, or the everimproving strategies in a game like chess, provide familiar examples. Adaptive systems may settle down temporarily at a local optimum, where performance is good in a comparative sense, but they are usually uninteresting if they remain at that optimum for an extended period. A theory of complex adaptive systems based on AAA makes possible the development of well-defined, yet flexible, models that exhibit emergent behavior. Such models can capture a wide range of economic phenomena precisely, even though the development of a general mathematical theory of complex adaptive systems is still in its early stages.'

The identification of factors which affect farm level productivity in the study area are also considered. The results reveal that the efficiency of management in both large and small farms is the same; and that large farms appear not to be more efficient than small farms. The study also indicates that increasing the ulitilization of cultivated land and machinery service and raising the output price are important if production is to increase. Collapse"

The results suggest that the specification of the dependent variable is a crucial issue in the debate over the linkage between deficits and interest rates, The evidence shows a positive and significant effect of various measures of the Federal Government deficit and debt on the real tax-adjusted Treasury bill rate in both the levels and the first-differenced equations but not on the nominal tax-adjusted rate. The positive and significant deficit-debt coefficients are also confirmed when the first-differenced equation is estimated by instrumental variables and when the equation is estimated over various time periods. Thus, there is robust evidence of a positive linkage between federal government borrowing and the tax-adjusted real but not nominal interest rates. Collapse"

In support of a recent hypothesis for the mechanism of qE (Horton et al. (1991) FEBS Lett. 292, 1–4), it was found that absorbence changes at 530 nm were associated with qE and LHCII aggregation. Antimycin A inhibited these changes and prevented LHCII aggregation, as indicated by the electrophoretic mobility of the complex and its low-temperature fluorescence spectrum. An antimycin-insensitive partial aggregation of LHCII was associated with an absorbance change at 505 nm. Low concentration of detergent caused disaggregation of LHCII and the reversal of qE. These data are discussed in terms of the relationship between structural change in LHCII and the mechanism of non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence in thylakoids. Collapse"

Spectral analysis and a VAR (vector autoregressive) model are used in the analysis. The preliminary results suggest a positive relationship between stock returns and money supply along a business cycles and high frequency cycles. A detailed analysis, however, suggests the spurious character of this observed relationship. The money/stock returns relationship over business cycles can be explained by a contemporaneous adjustment of stock returns and anticipated money in response to business cycle anticipations. The high frequency relationship, on the other hand, can be related to contemporaneous adjustment of stock returns and money anticipations in response to expected inflation in a framework characterized by the anticipation of the Federal Reserve Reaction Function. The empirical results strongly suggest that both stock returns and money anticipations are determined in a forward-looking manner incorporating the informat... Collapse"

One way to maintain this status and, at the same time, supply the increased demand for this wood is through the establishment of plantations. Therefore, the knowledge of M. urundeuva wood properties in plantations with young trees is essential. Thus, we evaluated we evaluated some physical and mechanical properties of wood from 20-year-old M. urundeuva (aroeira) twelve trees in a homogenous plantation. Basic density was 770 kg m-3 and apparent density was 984 kg m-3. The anisotropy coefficient of 1.69 is considered regular, indicating that wood can be used in the manufacture of fine furniture, frames, boats, musical instruments, sports equipment or flooring. The wood presented good mechanical behavior, with an average strength for parallel compression of 53.84 MPa, MOE of 12632 MPa and MOR of 123.58 MPa. The wood was identified as class 40, thus showing potential for use in medium-sized structures and construction. Basic density and apparent density correlated positively with compression parallel to the grain and MOR. Wood quality, a positive characteristic, added to good technology, even in young trees, shows that values of physical and mechanical properties are suitable for various uses when compared to the same values of older trees based on specialized literature. Our results confirmed that this homogeneous planting was adequate to obtain M. urundeuva wood with such quality. Collapse"

106734,1991,applied economics,the stability of cigarette demand,the stability of cigarette demand,"The photograph on the cover of Susan Seymour’s biography of anthropologist Cora Du Bois (1903–1991) presents an image of an intense woman, a cigarette hanging out of the corner of her mouth, looking off at an angle at some unknown object or person. Du Bois looks as if she belongs in a 1940s film noir. There is no hint of a smile. In fact, with all the photographs of Du Bois, only in those from her childhood and the one from when she was retired do we see her clearly smiling. The book’s images may reflect only the author’s choices, but the photographs’ message that those years came with difficulties is consistent with the written narrative. Even among anthropologists, Cora Du Bois is not a well-known name—another pioneering woman and lesbian whose story has been lost. Anthropologist Susan C. Seymour was first Du Bois’ student, then friend, colleague, and now biographer. She wrote this book to bring back into prominence this scholar, the first women full professor with tenure at Harvard University, who also served as a high-ranking intelligence officer during World War II. As a lesbian, Du Bois’ remarkable life was complicated by changing global events and shifting political and social climates in the United States. Du Bois’ story adds to our understanding of a relatively understudied cohort of professional women born too late for the great wave of women’s 19th-century and progressive-era activism and change and too early to benefit from the reemergence of feminism. Throughout this biography the author sets a theme that our culture ceased to have spaces for someone such as Du Bois during most of the 20th century. While Du Bois’ class and race privilege allowed her to enter and to succeed in her chosen field, the sexism, homophobia, and political repressions of her era meant that even her accomplishments came at a personal cost. Her abilities and accomplishments demanded recognition, but the positions she earned were grudgingly given and far from comfortable or accommodating. Cora Du Bois’ earliest years were unsettled and atypical. As her Swiss-born father worked to reestablish his business in the early 1900s, Cora moved between the United States and Europe. Eventually, the family settled in the United States, in a large home in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. Her father was loving and supportive. Her mother was capable but intimidating. This period of stability ended when Cora’s father died the summer she graduated from high school. After a year helping her mother deal with this loss, Cora began commuting to Barnard College. Although her major was history, her senior-year anthropology course with Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict (Margaret Mead was the T.A.) determined her future. Concurrent with her mother’s remarriage, which gave her daughter sufficient wealth to be financially independent, Cora entered the graduate program in anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley. There she excelled, finding in California mentors—Professors Lowie and Kroeber—as well as a lover and circle of lesbian friends. Du Bois earned her PhD from Berkeley in 1932. Fulltime positions were scarce during the Depression, especially for women; Du Bois’ wealth and a few grants gave her the flexibility to continue with part-time or temporary positions. She built an impressive reputation through innovative fieldwork and teaching, produced respected publications, and pioneered the “culture and personality movement” within American anthropology.

106752,1991,applied economics,central bank credibility and forecasting,central bank credibility and forecasting,"The relation between money and the economy during the 1980s has caused many economists to reassess their position on the desirability of using the money supply to guide monetary policy. Primary issues include the measurement of money and variability in the lags in monetary policy. The importance that many economists and policy-makers place on money growth has diminished as many believe that the lagged effects of money on real output and prices have either increased, become less reliable or vanished. As the experi­ ence of the 19808 continues to confound the profession, it is commonplace for economists to suggest that more data are needed before we can understand how money is now affecting the economy. This paper examines the hypothesis that .the predictive ability of money is affected by central bank policy. It is hypothesized that the ability to forecast the short-run and long-run lagged influences of money on real output and prices is affected by central bank policy. This hypothesis follows the 'Lucas (1976) critique' which argues that model predictability is influenced by policy regimes. In our case, predictions of real output and inflation based on a model whose coefficients are estimated from one policy regime may be expected to deteriorate rapidly when policy regimes change. An implication ofthis hypothesis is that when policy regimes change the conventional dictum that 'more data are better than less data' is not necessarily true when one forecasts economic variables that are influenced by those public policies. As a test of this hypothesis, this paper examines the predictive ability of money in the 1980s. It is argued that 1980s monetary policy is more similar to the 1960s than that of the 1970s and, therefore, real output and inflation in the 1980s should be better predicted from a model based on the experience of the 1960s versus the 1970s. Because support for this hypothesis is found, it is concluded that the 1980s relation between money and the economy is better under­ stood when recent data (1970s) are excluded in favour of past data (1960s) that more closely approximate central bank behaviour in the prediction interval. The paper conclu­ des with several policy implications. Collapse"

We are particularly concerned with whether technical change biases have been induced by changes in relative factor prices accompanied by rapid economic growth in Korea. Our test results show that technical change in Korea has been biased in the direction in the direction for saving labour and using capital, thus rendering support to the induced innovation hypothesis. These findings are roughly in parallel with empirical studies on the induced innovation hypothesis for the US and Japanese economies. The similar pattern in technical change biases between Korea and the two advanced economies is noteworthy in light of their basic differences in factor endowments. Another salient feature of our empirical analysis is that the price-corrected labour share in Korea has continually shrunk in the process of rapid economic growth, which has been partly precipitated by factor price-disorting policies.

106790,1991,british journal of industrial relations,'them and us': social psychology and 'the new industrial relations.',them and us social psychology and the new industrial relations,"This article sets out to examine the impact of ‘new industrial relations’ techniques on worker attitudes to management and to worker-management relations. We found 17 case studies of share schemes, profit-sharing, quality circles and autonomous work-groups which reported relevant evidence on worker attitudes. Although workers often welcome new industrial relations techniques, there is very little evidence of any impact on ‘them and us’ attitudes. Drawing on social-psychological theories of attitude change, the persistence of ‘them and us’ attitudes can be explained by the ways in which new industrial relations techniques have been implemented and managed in organisations. Workers have often lacked choice over participation in new schemes; there has been a lack of trust between the parties involved, together with inequality in status and benefits and a lack of institutional support for the schemes among senior management. It is argued that these conditions explain the failure of new organisational initiatives to bring about changes in ‘them and us’ attitudes. Collapse"
106913,1991,econometric theory,asymptotically efficient estimation of cointegration regressions,asymptotically efficient estimation of cointegration regressions,"An asymptotic optimality theory for the estimation of cointegration regressions is developed in this paper. The theory applies to a reasonably wide class of estimators without making any specific assumptions about the probability distribution or short-run dynamics of the data-generating process. Due to the nonstandard nature of the estimation problem, the conventional minimum variance criterion does not provide a convenient measure of asymptotic efficiency. An alternative criterion, based on the concentration or peakedness of the limiting distribution of an estimator, is therefore adopted. The limiting distribution of estimators with maximum asymptotic efficiency is characterized in the paper and used to discuss the optimality of some known estimators. A new asymptotically efficient estimator is also introduced.

A consistent estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimator is given, and the Wald, Lagrange multiplier, and likelihood ratio tests for linear restrictions on the parameters are discussed. A Lagrange multiplier test for heteroscedasticity based upon the absolute residuals is analyzed. This will be useful whenever the heights of the density functions are related to the dispersions.

After identifying the input parameters to the system as well as output data from the system, the first stage in the system development is the fuzzification of the data. FL toolbox in Matlab have different type of membership functions but the triangular (trimf) and trapezoid (trapmf) membership functions were used. The fuzzy inference system (FIS) is created using FL toolbox in Matlab and it is named stlfnew1. There are two types of fuzzy inference method; Mamdani and Sugeno. The FIS used is Mamdani because it is the most commonly seen fuzzy methodology and its output membership functions are fuzzy sets while that of Sugeno are either linear or constant.

Approaches to Load Forecasting There are three major approaches to LF. These include manual, statistical, and artificial intelligence. a. Manual approach: This is the approach in which the operator uses his or her experience and intuition to obtain a good guess of the load demand. This approach is inefficient, noneffective and time consuming. It is prone to too much error. These limitations render this method not appropriate for load forecasting in getting correct result. b. Statistical approach: This is the approach that depends largely on historical data of electric load consumption. This approach usually requires a statistical model that represents load as function of different factors such as time of the day, weather, and customer class. It involves the use of historical data and produces instant result. Statistical packages are readily available, though expensive. The historical load data used by this approach may not always be available especially in the developing countries. Load behaviour experiences sudden change which statistical method cannot always cope with. Therefore, this approach is not most appropriate for use in STELF. Statistical approach includes multiple linear regression (MLP), Adaptive models, general exponential smoothing, stochastic time series and state-space methods. c. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Approach: This is the approach which is used to study and design intelligent agents (a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success). In this work, this approach is subdivided into four major parts which includes: i. Genetic Algorithm: Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have recently received much attention as robust stochastic search algorithm for various problems (ELNaggar and AL-Rumaih, 2005). This method is based on the mechanism of natural selection and natural genetics, which combines the notion of survival of the fittest, random and yet structured, search and parallel evaluation of the points in the search space. GA accommodate all the facets of soft computing, namely uncertainty, imprecision, nonlinearity, and robustness. GA can be used to provide a good set of initial weights for Neural Network (NN), or can be used to fully train the NN or to find the optimal network structure (Haque and Kashtiban, 2005). ii. Neural network: This approach depends solely on data. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or simply put Neural Network (NN) acquires input variables from the historical database and output the forecasted load. When the ANN is in the learning stage (Feinberg and Genethliou, 2006), the database is used as training set and the errors are back propagated until satisfactory levels of accuracy are achieved. This approach is weak at generalization and if not well trained, it can over fit the data. ANN approach is not interactive in nature and cannot provide explanation to the operator on what he needs to know. NN though accurate in weekday load forecasting (Dash et al, 1995) is poor at forecasting peak loads and holiday loads. NN based load forecasts give large errors when the weather profile changes very fast. iii. Rule-based approach: This approach entails using a set of assertions, which collectively form the 'working memory', and a set of rules that specify how to act on the assertion set. Rule-based systems are a good choice (Caudil, 1991) when one has only a few data samples, when one has experts that are readily available for consultation, or when one finds that an explanation for answer is essential. Rule-base is modular in nature, in that it allows for modification. New rules can be added and old ones can be deleted, since rules are independent of one another. An example of rule-based system is an expert system (ES). ES differs from other kinds of AI in that it deals with subject matter of realistic complexity that normally requires a considerable amount of human expertise; exhibits high performance in terms of speed and reliability (Jackson, 1999). This makes ES to be a useful tool, capable of explaining and justifying solutions or recommendations to convince the user that its reasoning is in fact correct. ES provides a number of benefits according to Beckman (1991) which include reduce costs; improved quality; increased revenue; retention of expertise and easy distribution of expertise. iv. Fuzzy Logic: Fuzzy logic is a generalization of the usual Boolean logic used for digital circuit design (Feinberg and Genethliou, 2006). An input under Boolean logic takes on a truth-value of ""0"" or ""1"". Under fuzzy logic, an input has associated with it a certain qualitative ranges. Fuzzy logic allows one to (logically) deduce outputs from fuzzy inputs. In this sense, fuzzy logic is one of a number of techniques for mapping inputs to outputs (i.e. curve fitting). Among the advantages of fuzzy logic are the absence of a need for a mathematical model mapping inputs to outputs and the absence of a need for precise (or even noise free) inputs. With such generic conditioning rules, properly designed fuzzy logic systems can be very robust when used for forecasting.

(2004) presented fault diagnosis of electric power systems using fuzzy Petri nets (FPN) as a modeling Tool. The validity and feasibility of this method is illustrated by simulation examples which shows from seven cases that the faulted system elements can be diagnosed correctly by use of these models, and a satisfying result can also be achieved even in the situation with large amount of incomplete and uncertain alarm information. Also, the merits of easy reasoning, fast diagnosing speed and strong practicability of fault diagnosis models based on FPN were demonstrated.. Wu (1998) presented a Petri net algorithm for multiple contingencies of Distribution system operation by combining with a new restoration approach. This approach is performed by releasing some loads required to maintain the rest system in safe operation in overload cases and opening all of the switches in the out-of-service areas for fault cases, and then closing proper switches to restore the isolated areas. Heuristic rules and valuation functions were presented for the best first search in the Petri nets (PN). A practical Taiwan power (Taipower) distribution system was simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Combining with the proposed restoration algorithm, the Petri net and its inference processing are efficiently implemented using C++. It was concluded that multiple contingencies of distribution systems could be solved by the proposed method effectively. Iyanda et al. (2011) presented a short-term electric load forecasting in uncertain domain using fuzzy decision tree approach. The fundamental requirement for the proposed model is the production of robust and accurate performance with minimal computational and data resources. Solution strateg"

In particular, the notion of hierarchy provides a useful tool when one wants to draw inferences on the structural change or international difference of industrial structures. The standard technique for studying this notion is to triangularize the input-output table by interchanging sectors in order to maximize the entries below the main diagonal. In a perfect triangularized table, the entries above the main diagonal should be zero. For example, such a strong one-way interdependence relation as cotton-textiles-clothing can easily establish the hierarchy. Due to the existence of circular relations like coal-steel-mining equipment-coal, it is not possible to triangularize the input-output table perfectly. This paper extends and revises the previous triangulation method which is based on a permutation theorem deriving from the interchange of adjoining two industrial groups, into that among three industrial groups (Theorem 2). The new algorithm based on Theorem 2 is demonstrated by actually computing the suboptimal orderings for the four input-output tables for such more developed countries (MDC's) as the United States, Italy, Norway, Japan, and the two tables for such less developed countries (LDC's) as India and Korea. The empirical results suggest that sectors can be arranged in a similar hierarchical order among MDC's and LDC's. Transport Equipment, Machinery, Apparel, Leather and Products, Grain Mill Products, and Processed Foods, which link directly to the final demand, are recorded as higher-order sectors. Trade, Transport, and Services are lower-order ones, and Energy sectors such as Electric Power, Coal Products, Coal Mining, Petroleum, Petroleum Products and Natural Gas are the lowest. Consequently, this paper provides some more evidence in support of the similarity of hierarchical structures of production among these countries. Collapse"

The prevailing consensus of the 1970s concerning the substance of the model itself-typically characterized in terms of the Chinese leadership's objectives and priorities and its strategy for pursuing them-has stood up quite well. The same cannot be said about past appraisals of the extent to which China's economic reality has been reshaped to accord with the model's prescriptions. One of the most widely remarked elements of the Chinese model is the high priority assigned to regional objectives and, more specifically, to ""balance"" in the distribution of productive capacity and equity in the distribution of income and, hence, consumption. During the Maoist era (i.e., prior to 1979), the central government pursued regional objectives through such measures as interregional transfers of investment resources (effected via the planning system), subsidization of health and education expenditures in poor regions, and attempts to maintain a safety net of state relief (effected largely via control of grain surpluses). In short, there is little doubt that prior to 1979 the Chinese leadership placed an unusually high value on the spread of modern growth and the improvements in welfare associated with it and persistently acted to limit the emergence or widening of interregional disparities.' Although China's post-Mao leaders have shown greater concern with efficiency and with the potential trade-offs between efficiency and such goals as balance and equity, their continuation of many redistributive policies indicates that they have not abandoned regional objectives. But how successful has China been in achieving these objectives? Collapse"
106943,1991,economic development and cultural change,"relative efficiency, self-containment, and comparative costs of less developed countries",relative efficiency  self containment  and comparative costs of less developed countries,"International differences in comparative costs can in principle be attributed to three kinds of forces: factor proportions, economies of scale, and relative efficiency. To take a specific example, the low relative price of certain services in less developed countries might be attributed to the fact that the services in question are not at all intensive in either physical or human capital (the factor proportions account), that economies of scale are unimportant in these services, or that LDCs are relatively efficient in producing these services (as compared to their efficiency in producing, say, manufactured products). While it is obvious that differences in relative efficiency can affect comparative costs (and trade patterns), economists have tended to emphasize the factor proportions theory and economies of scale in their explanations. Part of the reason for this emphasis is that the relative efficiency explanation is rather empty, unless one can come up with explanations for the patterns of relative efficiency. The present article attempts to address these issues by looking at some data on relative product prices in a sample of less developed countries (LDCs) and more developed countries (MDCs). The data are taken from the purchasing-power parities collected by the International Comparison Project.' In the course of the research project it was discovered that neither the factor proportions theory nor the economies of scale phenomenon could account for more than a rather small part of the observed variation in relative product prices. The research was then directed toward explaining the remaining variation in relative product prices by looking at some product characteristics that were thought to affect relative efficiency. There are many characteristics of goods that may be hypothesized to affect the relative efficiency of LDCs compared to MDCs. These Collapse"
106944,1991,economic development and cultural change,the rise and demise of textiles and clothing in economic development: the case of japan,the rise and demise of textiles and clothing in economic development the case of japan,"In recent decades, producers of textiles and clothing in advanced industrial economies were the first large group of manufacturers who went into a decline as a result of import competition from newly industrializing economies. This occurred primarily because many processes in textile and clothing production tend to be intensive in the use of unskilled labor and so, as unskilled labor becomes relatively scarce in the advanced economies, comparative advantage gradually moves to countries less well endowed with physical and human capital per worker.' However, only a subset of countries with low capital-labor ratios are likely to become exporters of labor-intensive manufactures. That subset is limited to newly industrializing economies which are also poorly endowed with natural resources per worker and hence characterized by low real wages for labor that is attracted from primary production to industry as industrial capital expands. The dominance of East Asia's resource-poor, rapidly growing economies in satisfying the growing demand for imports of textiles and clothing by advanced industrial countries certainly supports this theory. One purpose of this article is to show that this theory is also supported strongly by evidence provided over the longer term by Japan's experience. That evidence shows that the resource-poor, rapidly industrializing Japanese economy gradually strengthened its comparative advantage in textiles and clothing from late last century, but subsequently lost this advantage steadily during the postwar period as exports of these items dwindled and imports from newly industrializing neighbors rose. In addition, the Japanese experience supports two cor- Collapse"

Liberalisation policies, as elaborated in the Berg report (1991) and subsequent World Bank documents, stressed the importance of reversing stagnation in agricultural tradables by ‘getting prices right’ and removing state monopolies on marketing. Increasing producer prices and devaluing overvalued exchange rates was seen as the means of increasing export revenues and reducing current account deficits. This paper examines the performance of agricultural tradables through the reform phase for a selection of sub-Saharan African countries to see how far recovery has taken place. The descriptive statistics show that agricultural tradables recovery has not been sustained and that in real terms, prices have fallen rather than risen, while the relative prices of non-tradables have increased. A simple model of the determinants of tradables output is tested using data for 14 SSA countries and six major tradables. The results show that, contrary to conventional theory, none of the price variables underlying liberalisation are significantly associated with tradables output, indicating the importance of non-price factors such as the reform of institutions. The final part of the paper examines variations in the relevant institutional arrangements and evidence for ‘export pessimism’ attitudes which may have hindered sustained tradables recovery and the alleviation of rural poverty.

Agriculture has traditionally been the dominant industry there, but its importance is being eroded by the growth of manufacturing and services. This shift has been aided by federal government policies, which have provided jobs through direct government employment and have offered tax breaks, subsidies, advice, and encouragement to large manufacturing firms in the region.

This apparent dualism in the urban economy has been a concern of students of economic development for many years. Several international agencies, notably the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the World Bank, have focused attention on this phenomenon. The ILO popularized the terms ""formal sector"" and ""informal sector"" to describe this dichotomy. To many economists, one consequence of this dualism is labor market segmentation.' Labor market segmentation plays a crucial role in explanations provided for some important issues, such as rural-urban migration, urban poverty, unemployment, underemployment, and growth.2 In this article I examine the hypothesis that labor market segmentation exists in San Jos6, Costa Rica, between the public and private-formal sectors and between the privateformal and informal sectors (defined in the Appendix). I define labor market segmentation as a situation where, because of institutional barriers to occupational mobility between sectors, a worker in the lower sector has less than full access to a job in the upper sector held by an observationally identical worker.3 If there were no barriers, workers in the low wage sector would enter the high wage sector and force the wages in that sector down until wages across sectors were equalized. That is, labor market segmentation implies differences in wages for observationally identical workers. Relying on this inference, most of the empirical literature on labor market segmen- Collapse"

For this purpose a production function approach is used and the analysis is conducted not only for the new crop varieties but also for their traditional counterparts.

And later, in the Journal of Economic Education, Stigler argued that ""economics belongs in everyone's education once we have learned how to teach it"" [1970, 80]. As we enter the nineties, academic economists continue groping for methods and techniques that will improve the way in which principles courses are taught. The proliferation of commercially available materials in the form of textbooks, workbooks, software, telecourses (e.g., Economics USA), and transparencies provides evidence of the increasing interest and expenditure aimed at improving the teaching of economics. However, there exists at least one very promising teaching technique that continues to see relatively limited action in the typical economics classroom. While experimental economic methods have become quite familiar to academic economists as a legitimate and powerful research tool, their usefulness for the economics classroom has not yet been generally recognized.(1) In this article, I describe a simple, yet powerful, public goods experiment for use in microeconomics or public finance courses. Since it is likely that many instructors in economics are reluctant to use experimental methods without sufficient preparation,(2) enough detail on experiment administration and suggested post-experiment discussion is provided to assist even the novice experimenter with getting started. Instructors interested in additional information on experimental economics or experiments for the classroom should consult the references listed in the concluding section. I. EXPERIMENT DESCRIPTION(3) A theoretical concept that introductory students often find hard to understand is the vertical summation of individual demand curves to obtain the market demand for a public good. The typical student also fails to fully appreciate how a free rider can cause underinvestment in public goods. The experiment outlined below provides a simple, yet powerful, technique to teach not only the vertical addition and the free rider problems, but also an ideal way to construct a prisoner's dilemma game and discuss the resulting underinvestment in the public good. Students are placed into N teams, where a ""team"" may be as few as one person. Each team is endowed with T tokens and must choose, in each of the decision-making rounds, whether to ""invest"" these tokens in the ""private account"" or the ""group account."" The private account will pay the team $0.30 per token invested each round. The group account will earn, for the entire ""society,"" $0.50 per token invested each round. From the group account, each team will then receive ($0.50) [G.sub.i]/N where [G.sub.i] equals the total number of tokens invested in the group account in round i by all N teams. Note that regardless of how many tokens any single team places into the group account, all N teams receive the same payout from the group account. Teams must invest all T tokens in each round and tokens cannot carry over from one round to the next. Finally, earnings from previous rounds are not allowed to be reinvested in the future. II.

106969,1991,economic journal,economics beyond the horizon,economics beyond the horizon,"Background: Entrepreneurship capabilities are considered a key element for the economic and sustainable development of countries, which must be understood as a complex phenomenon beyond enterprise generation, so it is necessary to start its development from an early age. Taking this in consideration, the purpose of this research is to propose a development model of entrepreneurship capabilities for the teenage population of the Atlántico Department, looking for the acknowledgment and strengthening of the capabilities on the different social contexts, starting from the revision of the conceptual basis that describe, analyze and interpret entrepreneurship as a defining element for the economic and social development of the country. Objective:Explain the interaction between potential and effective entrepreneurial abilities in adolescents aged 13 to 19 in the Atlantic department. Materials and Methods: To achieve this purpose, an empirical analytic research, of a projective type, with a non-experimental design transactional analysis was performed, to a sample of 1.579 young people with ages between 13 and 19 years old that were part of Educational Institutions of the municipalities of Atlántico. An assessment instrument was designed as a survey that would evaluate the defined categories for entrepreneurship capabilities: personal factors, entrepreneurship formation, and socio-cultural factors. After the collection and validation of information performed by Educational Institutions, we went on to identify the methodology of operationalization of the variables for their posterior use in the model proposal, from the answers to the survey, with the construction of complex indicators and the modeling of the structure of entrepreneurship for teenagers of Atlántico, by a Structural Equations System. Results: The main results of this research show how the potential entrepreneurship capability affects in a direct and positive way the effective entrepreneurship capability, this last one being determined by personal aspects, defined in terms of personal features like life skills, and observing a moderating role for family factors and a partial mediation effect between the potential entrepreneurship capability, the entrepreneurship formation, and the entrepreneurship capability. Conclusions: The theoretical model of the interaction of entrepreneurship capabilities in teenagers of the Atlántico Department, the result of this research, highlights the complexity of the effective entrepreneurship capability, since this one is affected by multiple personal, cognitive, familial, educational and cultural factors, clearly showing the effect that in a direct or indirect way these factors may have in the others and a potentializer of success in entrepreneurship initiatives. This study has important contributions for researchers and for the creation of public policies that allow strengthening the potential entrepreneurship capabilities in the different development environments of teenagers.

What I shall therefore do in this note is avoid even trying to make a prediction of which way we will be moving in economics research. Instead, I will outline the kind of work I would like to see come to fruition in the field in which my current research interest lies; namely, the economics of destitution. We need a redirection in how we go about our research in this area. My motivation here springs from an unease I have over methodological matters in current studies of poverty in poor countries.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to provide a solid theoretical or empirical justification for Nash equilibrium behaviour. ‘Rationality’, or even ‘common knowledge of rationality’, is not enough to generate such behaviour. Among other things, one also needs to assume that the players coordinate their beliefs about each other’s actions (Armbruster and Boege, 1979; Johansen, 1982; Bernheim, 1984; Pearce, 1984; Bernheim, 1986; Binmore, 1987; Aumann, 1987; Tan and Werlang, 1988; Aumann and Brandenburger, 1991). Moreover, in games with a dynamic structure, the very notion of rationality becomes problematic, and common knowledge of rationality may even lead to logical contradictions (Rosenthal, 1981; Binmore, 1987; Bicchieri, 1989; Basu, 1988, 1990).

106991,1991,economic journal,the interface between environmental and trade policies,the interface between environmental and trade policies,"This paper argues that the achievement of sustainable development requires, inter alia, the development of a framework of appropriate 'tools' to aid project, programme and policy development and implementation. Such a framework could usefully be called 'sustainability analysis'. It is likely to comprise a harmonised range of existing methodologies, some modified to address changing requirements (eg, modified EIA procedures to effectively include social, participatory and economic issues in order to address the key links between environmental impact and sustainable development), and some new elements (eg, indicators of sustainability). The need for sustainability analysis and particularly for indicators of sustainability is a key requirement to implement and monitor the development of national sustainable development plans, as required by Agenda 21 agreed at UNCED in June 1992. 1. EIA A Tool in Need of Overhaul Since its introduction in 1969 in the USA, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has become widely used as a tool for project analysis. An increasing number of countries are introducing legislation which requires EIAs for certain categories of development. In line with this trend, bilateral and multilateral donors have introduced procedures, manuals and guidelines for the environmental assessment of projects. In 1985, the OECD introduced recommendations for its members on the environmental assessment of development assistance projects and programmes, followed in 1986 by recommended measures to facilitate such EIAs. Principles for project appraisal were developed in 1988 by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and recommendations were agreed by the OECD Council in 1989 concerning an environmental checklist for high-level decision-makers in aid agencies. The essence of these various recommendations has been incorporated within the new DAC guidelines for ""Good Practice for the EIA of Development Projects"" (OECD, 1991). The World Bank has also published recently a very useful three-volume Environmental Assessment Sourcebook (World Bank, 1991). However, despite the increasing adoption and formalisation of EIA procedures internationally, EIA is still seen by many principally as a technical instrument, and it is wrongly assumed by some to be useful only for application at a relatively advanced stage in the project cycle, or as a disasteror crisismanagement tool. This is unfortunate because the potential of EIA is really as an 'attitude' and as a process which can be applied to all projects and programmes throughout their development and implementation and, with modification or adaptation, to policies. EIA has suffered a bad image amongst many of those involved in promoting sustainable development. This is because the tool has been used inappropriately or on limited components of the sustainable development system (see Figure 1). Those who have employed EIA have rarely integrated successfully environmental, social and economic issues the three most vital components of the equation. In Figure 1, sustainable development takes place within the central interactive zone (shaded) between the economic, the environmental/biological and the social/cultural systems. It is subject to a continual process of trade-offs between these systems. Intuitively, it is evident that development cannot be sustainable if one of these systems is not incorporated. In the main, current EIA practice identifies and estimates the environmental impacts of development projects in physical terms. Techniques of social cost-benefit analysis (SCBA) are sometimes included in an EIA to widen its terms of reference. These are aimed at assessing the costs and benefits (including Figure 1: The Sustainable Development System INTERFACE EXAMPLES OF ANALYTICAL TOOL EXAMPLES OF PLANNING PROCESSES A Traditional EIA National Conservation Strategies Sectoral Natural Resource Strategies B Social Cost Benefit Analysis Traditional Development Plans C Some Human Ecology & Anthropology Studies UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme D Sustainability Analysis (modified EIA) National Sustainable Development Plans/Strategies Note: This diagram is illustrative only and is not intended to imply that all EIA and SCBA studies are narrowly focussed. Whilst current EIA approaches are focussed primarily at the interface between the environmental and economic systems (eg, the impact of enterprises on habitat), it is recognised that other forms of EIA have incorporated some social dimensions. environmental impacts) in monetary terms as far as possible, and in qualitative terms where this is not possible. But SCBA techniques have largely been developed independently of EIA, although the demarcation lines between them are often blurred. As Lee (1991) points out, ""some SCBA studies have to ignore environmental impacts or express them in physical units, where monetary measures are unavailable"", whilst some EIA studies include ""employment and other socio-economic impacts Alongside the environmental impacts"". Whilst SCBA has been used as a valid tool for assessing the social and economic 'worth' of project or policies, the quantification of the costs and benefits of environmental impacts is often (some might say usually) not undertaken, mainly due to the insufficiency of required data and to continuing controversy over some of the techniques available. However, it is not always easy to compare environmental, social and economic impacts. Lee (1991) quite correctly asks, ""how should the overall environmental impact of development be evaluated or how can the aggregate environmental impact be compared with the economic and social impacts when reaching a decision on a project ?"". It is argued by some that the task is greatly simplified by expressing environmental impacts in monetary terms whilst others find monetary valuation unacceptable and argue that other means are required. The prominence that this debate has now achieved arises due to several factors, including recent advances in the methodology of monetary valuation (e.g., OECD, 1989; Pearce et.al.,1989; Winpenny, 1991) and official encouragement for the use of monetary valuation (World Bank, 1991; Department of the Environment, 1991). Admittedly, EIAs carried out in the last few years what we might call 'new generation' EIAs are giving more attention to social issues. But, whilst public consultation is now a recognised norm in full EIAs, EIAs are rarely conducted in a truly participatory way, and project beneficiaries are seldom involved adequately in the process. Although EIAs are being extended to include measures of the damage costs associated with adverse environmental impacts, comprehensive monetary valuation and economic analysis of environmental costs and benefits are seldom included (Barbier, et.al., 1991). There is, however, a widening recognition of the urgent need to modify EIA approaches, to place greater emphasis on its practical application, and to address the links between EIA and sustainable development. It has to recognised, however, that EIA alone cannot make development sustainable although ""it can help push decisionmakers along the path towards sustainability"" (Clarke, 1991). EIA will be an important tool in the 'kit bag' required to back up the development of national sustainable development plans. 2. National Sustainable Development Plans One of the main outcomes of UNCED was ratification of Agenda 21 which set priorities for achieving sustainable development. Real action, particularly in the context of international conventions and the priorities contained in agenda 21, takes place at the local and national level. This is where there is knowledge, concern, involvement and the capacity to act. This is where the focus of strategic planning processes should lie. It is a major encouragement, therefore, that Agenda 21 rightly recommends that translation of its priorities for action be focussed at the national level through sustainable development plans. Planning for sustainable development at the national level is nothing new, of course. There are many different approaches, many of which are advocated by different aid agencies in different contexts (see Box 1). Box 1: Some examples of national planning approaches § National Conservation Strategies, led by IUCN; § National Environmental Action Plans, led by the World Bank; § National Tropical Forest Action Plans, led by FAO; § National Plans to Combat Desertification, led by UNEP/UNSO; § National Energy Assessments, led by the World Bank; § Economic-cum-environmental development planning, led by the Asian Development Bank; § A variety of environmental strategies and country environment profiles prepared by bilateral aid donors; and § The UNCED national reports on sustainable development. To this list may shortly be added the ""national plans"" that will arise out of the international climate and biodiversity It can be assumed that the proponents of each of the various approaches listed in Box 2 will be promoting them vigorously as 'the way' towards sustainable development planning. Some of the initiatives listed have enjoyed considerable success. A number of them aim to deal with the wide range of issues implicit in the concept of sustainable development. But again, it needs to be recognised that most are weak on environmental economics and whilst they usually purport to be participatory and country-oriented, they tend, in fact, to be driven largely by outside agencies (Sandbrook et.al.,1992). Many of the approaches overlap in subject and geographical scope, and some have been duplicated in the same country. An analysis of the documents on any one country arising from these national initiatives indicates that they have used essentially the same data, but rarely have the results of any public consultations been included. Their preparation usually involves foreign consultants talking to the same people in the governments who, in turn, have to meet conflicti Collapse"

With full integration of capital markets the choice with respect to the inwardness of a technology is irrelevant: investment will be channeled to the more productive sectors, independently of their trade inwardness, With limited capital market integration a given investment will generate two effects. The first is the standard, direct productivity effect that is associated with the change in future output. The second is the trade dependency externality, generated by the change in future bargaining outcomes due to the change in the trade dependency of the nation. With partial integration, investment that increases trade dependency is desirable. If the credit markets are disjoint due to partial defaults, higher trade dependency is disadvantageous. Thus, higher trade dependency generates a positive externality with partial integration of capital markets, and a negative externality with disjoint credit markets. We show that credit market integration is determined by the size of the indebtedness relative to the trade dependency, as reflected by the repayment burden that is supported by the bargaining outcome. The repayment bargaining outcome is determined by the sectoral composition of the economy and by the effective size of the developing and the developed economies. Collapse"

To what extent is this due to an effect of duration and to what extent to heterogeneity? On reasonable assumptions, heterogeneity on its own (with no duration-dependence) would imply that, if over time the exit rate of new entrants fell by a given multiple, the overall exit rate from unemployment should fall by the same multiple. However, over the last twenty years in the UK the overall exit rate has fallen by 60 per cent more than the fall in the exit rate of new entrants. Another test of 'pure heterogeneity', based on more general assumptions, also fails. Hence we explain the overall fall in exit rates from unemployment by the combined effect of (1) a fall in the ratio of vacancies to unemployed, and (2) a higher proportion of the unemployed being long-term unemployed, and hence demoralized and stigmatized in the eyes of employers.

107127,1991,energy economics,election returns as a signal of changing regulatory climate,election returns as a signal of changing regulatory climate,"Abstract This paper considers the effects of changes in regulatory climate on the expected future profitability of regulated electric utilities. Previous researchers addressing issues relating to regulatory environment have examined the determinants of investor perceptions of regulatory climate, the effect that the method of commissioner selection in particular has on regulatory climate, and the effects of regulatory climate on the cost of capital to the regulated firm. This paper seeks to ascertain the importance of regulatory climate by examining the stock market performance of regulated electric utilities at the time of an unanticipated change in regulatory environment. These results indicate that in those states in which the change in regulatory climate was most clearly unanticipated, an adverse change in the regulatory environment did result in negative abnormal returns to utilities operating in those states, thereby indicating a reduction in the expected future profitability of the regulated firms. In addition our results provide support for the proposition that the firm's systematic risk is lower when enforcement of regulation is more stringent. Collapse"

The issues include why the NRC chose external funding mechanisms, how the funds should be collected and invested, the relationship between the NRC and state agencies, and fund assurance in a variety of cases including possible accident and bankruptcy.

107165,1991,energy journal,managing qualified nuclear decommissioning trust funds under uncertainty,managing qualified nuclear decommissioning trust funds under uncertainty,"Funds for the eventual decommissioning and removal of nuclear power plants are accumulating. The amount will total many tens, perhaps hundreds of billions, of dollars. One of the ingredients in setting aside these funds is managing them so as to assure that just enough cash is on hand at the time of decommissioning to meet all required expenses at the lowest possible net present value cost to utility ratepayers. As with any investment, there can be a variety of opinions. For this reason, it is important to consult several sources for advice on the investment of such nuclear decommissioning trust funds (NDTs). The next three chapters provide such advice from the perspective of three different firms. The first, by Howard Hiller, stresses the importance of an adaptive approach, pointing out that the most difficult question is the choice of investment maturities. Hiller employs a simulation methodology to quantify the riskcost characteristics of strategies along the maturity spectrum--from short to long-term. He identifies some of the unique uncertainties inherent in decommissioning and brings these uncertainties into his analysis. He concludes that the steepness of the municipal yield curve can be exploited even in the presence of inflationary uncertainty. Collapse"
107170,1991,energy journal,a cost/benefit perspective of extended unit service as a decommissioning alternative,a costbenefit perspective of extended unit service as a decommissioning alternative,"Some people consider life extension (and its cousin, license renewal) an alternative to decommissioning. The reasons for the popularity of such alternatives include presumed cost effectiveness, retention of scarce power plant sites, and the continued ability to pass on waste storage expenses as a cost of service. In this chapter, James Hewlett addresses nuclear power plant life extension- -which he calls NUPLEX--in its economic garb, starting with a look at the common utility presumption that life extension of a nuclear plant will allow it to produce electricity at a lower rate than new coal generation. This presumption, he argues, may not be supportable by analysis. He concludes that the deferral of constructing new replacement capacity would result in cost savings only if both the level and escalation rate of the operating costs for the refurbished unit fall substantially from 1986 levels. Therefore, it is unclear whether the deferral of the construction of new capacity would result in the cost savings, although it definitely shifts the financial burden into the future. Collapse"
107172,1991,energy journal,financial implications of early decommissioning,financial implications of early decommissioning,"There are three generalized timing possibilities for decommissioning: at the end of the original operating license, after some period of life extension, or sometime before the end of normal service. In this companion piece to his discussion of life extension in Chapter 20, James Hewlett addresses the third option. Premature decommissioning can arise--as it did for Unit 2 of Three Mile Island--from an accident, or--more commonly-because it may be cheaper to close the facility than to have it continue in operation. The economic implication of premature closure is one of potentially insufficient fund accumulation. As Hewlett points out, the decision to close a plant is complicated by decommissioning considerations; for example, the decision could depend in part on the status of the accumulated funds. Such a decision also can influence plans for new construction since it may delay the time of closure for existing plants. State regulatory bodies in the United States influence such decisions through their control over rates of return. In the end, decommissioning cost considerations often influence decommissioning timing. Collapse"

First, it identifies how much the presence of community hospital beds adds to the stock of physicians practicing in nonmetropolitan counties. Second, it estimates the impact hospital closures or other reductions in beds have on the net flow of physicians into rural counties. The study relies primarily on data from the 1981 and 1986 Physician Masterfiles of the American Medical Association. We find that hospital bed reductions and closures essentially do not affect the availability of physicians--they have apparently already left by the time the downsizing occurs. Further, population change and the number of physicians already in the county determine for the most part the entry or exit of physicians. Collapse"

Using multivariate time series models, we controlled for case mix and assessed trends over time and the impact of prospective payment on lengths of stay and rates of readmission within 7, 14, and 30 days of discharge. We examined patterns for patients overall and for those admitted initially with one of several specific medical conditions or for a surgical procedure. Over the four years, lengths of stay decreased by 25% overall and by 12% to 38% for the individual conditions studied (all p less than .05). A small part of this decrease was associated with prospective payment. Overall readmission rates within 7 and 14 days increased by approximately 10% (p less than .05), although the increase was not statistically associated with prospective payment. Readmission rates for individual medical and surgical conditions were not significantly changed. Further study should assess whether the change in overall rates reflects lower quality care. Collapse"

107311,1991,inquiry,a simultaneous equations model of employer strategies for controlling health benefit costs,a simultaneous equations model of employer strategies for controlling health benefit costs,"We estimated a simultaneous equations model of employer health insurance cost control strategies and their effectiveness in reducing health plan premiums. We hypothesized that as premiums increase, employers will shop more actively for health plans, place incentives on providers to control medical care costs, increase employee cost sharing for medical care, and be more likely to offer an HMO. In turn, we expected each of these strategies, except offering an HMO, to reduce average health plan premiums. The model was estimated with 1985 data from a sample of 922 Minnesota employers. We found that high premiums are related to three of the proposed cost control strategies. Employers with higher premiums shop more, are more likely to seek provider incentives, and offer an HMO. However, these employers appear to have lower employee cost sharing. Employers with higher employee cost sharing and those that offer an HMO had lower health plan premiums. Collapse"

This study of tax-exempt revenue bonds issued by hospitals from 1982-84 estimates that bond insurance lowers yields on hospital bonds by approximately 87 basis points and that bond insurance serves as a substitute measure of creditworthiness. The findings also suggest that the insured group of hospital bonds is more homogeneous than the uninsured group in terms of characteristics that affect the risks associated with hospital investments.

These allowable, normal profit rates are then compared with actual profit rates to evaluate the relative profitability of each line of insurance.

Hospital admissions from 10 IPAs are compared with admissions to the same hospital of persons covered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans or commercial insurance programs. Admissions of patients under age 65 to the adult medical service for the 10 most frequently occurring DRGs are included. Regression equations are estimated using length of stay as the dependent variable and IPA membership and hospital and patient characteristics as control variables. All 10 IPAs exhibit shorter lengths of stay as indicated by negative beta coefficients, and in 6 of the 10 IPAs this coefficient is statistically significant (p less than .05). This IPA effect occurs for 7 of the 10 study DRGs, and for MedisGroups Admission Severity Groups 0, 1, and 2. Collapse"

Firstly, a short outline of the historical roots of the controversial debates on the role of the state and the markets, and the organi-zation of competition in European railroad industries is provided. Secondly, the opening of the market for train services in the context of the liberalization of European transport markets since 1985 is characterized and the regulatory pre-conditions for competition on the tracks are presented. Thirdly, the evolution of track access regulation in Europe during the last decades is analyzed, differenti-ating between the period of negotiated third party access since 1991, the intro-duction of ex ante regulation by the first railroad infrastructure package in 2001, and the danger of overregulation posed by the recent Draft Directive of July 2012 establishing a single European railway area. Fourthly, the role of competi-tion on the markets for rail services and the reform process of interoperability requirements are considered. Finally, competition on the markets for rail ser-vices and public subsidies for rail infrastructures as well as subsidies for train services are evaluated. Collapse"

107342,1991,international journal of industrial organization,does ownership always matter?,does ownership always matter,Abstract The objective of this paper is to explain and illustrate the complex relationship between ownership arrangements and enterprise performance. It is commonly argued that efficiency will be lower in the public sector than the private because enterprise objectives deviate from maximisation of profits and because monitoring arrangements are inadequate due to the absence of capital market discipline. We argue that public ownership does make the owner-manager relationship more complicated because the chain of principals and agents is expanded; objectives are politically determined; and these are conveyed by a policy-making administrative structure to management. But the relative efficiency of public as against private ownership actually depends on the efficacy of capital market monitoring: on the political and constitutional system; on the information and sanctions available to policy makers; and on the nature of the management market. Variation in these factors can help to explain the different natures and roles of the public sector between countries. Collapse
107343,1991,international journal of industrial organization,the theory and measure of cross-subsidies: an application to the telecommunications industry,the theory and measure of cross subsidies  an application to the telecommunications industry,"Abstract The paper is made of two sections, the first one dealing with cross-subsidies in general and the second one referring specifically to the telecommunications industry. In the first section, we attempt to clarify the relationship between the theoretical approach to cross-subsidies, as it derives on the one hand from Faulhaber's seminal definition and the corpus of cooperative game theory, and from the accounting approach on the other hand, which consists in computing revenue trade-offs across types of products or types of customers. We emphasize the conditions under which a revenue trade-off signals a cross-subsidy in Faulhaber's sense. We finally show how revenue trade-offs across consumers during a price transition are first order approximations of welfare variations. In the second section, telecommunications are chosen as an application case. We first show that most of the issues presently at stake in this industry can helpfully be analysed in terms of cross-subsidies. We then examine the principles and methods which are utilized for costing and pricing by telecommunications companies in Canada and the United States. Finally, we present the results of a study assessing the revenue trade-offs across categories of services and across customer segments in the French telecommunications market. Collapse"
107344,1991,international journal of industrial organization,liberalizing european airlines: cost and factor productivity evidence,liberalizing european airlines cost and factor productivity evidence,"Abstract European countries do not all share the same view concerning the benefits of increased competition among airlines in Europe. To explain this difference in attitudes, the paper presents evidence on differences in costs and global factor productivity between the main European national flag carriers. The data reveal a clear distinction between the main European and North Atlantic routes. Unit costs per passenger-kilometer are lower in North Atlantic routes and unit profits are higher in European routes. The first result reflects the economies of scale due to higher distances and traffic density on North Atlantic routes. The second result is an indication of the lower level of competition between airlines in Europe. Finally, Tornqvist factor productivity growth indexes (1981–1986) show that the initial gap which existed between these productivity measures at the beginning of the period is shrinking. This suggests that the European airline industry is currently in a more favorable situation to support more competition. Collapse"
107361,1991,international organization,"can orthodox stabilization and adjustment work? lessons from new zealand, 1984-90",can orthodox stabilization and adjustment work  lessons from new zealand  1984 90,"Most debate about the efficacy of orthodox stabilization programs, such as those of the International Monetary Fund, has been fruitless. First, rarely are these programs fully implemented or sustained for long periods. Second, defenders and critics of the programs hold differing premises about the nature of capitalist economies. The debate is therefore not about the appropriate balance of supply-and demand-side measures but, rather, about what sort of supply- and demand-side measures will address the supply- and demand-side problems that each group perceives. The results of an orthodox stabilization program which incorporated demand- and supply-side elements and which was fully implemented and sustained by the New Zealand government from 1984 to 1990 reveal the limits to orthodox programs. New Zealand, a primary product exporter, suffers from a structural imbalance of payments and from an external debt burden equal in scale to that of the Latin American and other highly indebted less developed countries (LDCs), but it does not have the serious supplyside constraints on growth that critics claim typify underdeveloped economies. This makes New Zealand an appropriate test of the typical orthodox stabilization program. Despite the fact that its administrative capacity, political will, domestic support, and access to external resources were far in excess of those of the typical would-be LDC stabilizer, New Zealand achieved only a precarious macroeconomic and international payments stability. Moreover, as the case of New Zealand demonstrates, inflation control and financial liberalization policy components of orthodox plans have contradictory consequences for payments balance. This suggests that long-term stabilization, in New Zealand and elsewhere, cannot be achieved solely by internal reforms. Collapse"

This project represents the most extensive application of multiple imputation to date, and the modeling effort was considerable as well—hundreds of logistic regressions were estimated. One goal of this article is to summarize the strategies used in the project so that researchers can better understand how the new data bases were created. Another goal is to show how modifications of maximum likelihood methods were made for the modeling and imputation phases of the project. To multiply-impute 1980 census-comparable codes for industries and occupations in two 1970 census public-use samples, logistic regression models were estimated with flattening constants. For many of the regression models considered, the data were too sparse to support conventional maximum likelihood analysis, so some alternative had to be employed.

Both conditional-likelihood methods and mixture-model techniques have been used to circumvent these problems. In this article, we show that these seemingly unrelated analyses are in fact closely linked to each other, despite dramatic structural differences between the classes of models implied by each approach. We show that the finite-mixture model for J dichotomous items having T latent classes gives the same estimates of item parameters as conditional likelihood on a set whose probability approaches one if T ≥ (J + 1)/2. Unconditional maximum likelihood estimators for the finite-mixture model can be viewed as Keifer-Wolfowitz estimators for the random-effects version of the Rasch model. Latent-class versions of the model are especially attractive when T is... Collapse"
107394,1991,journal of the american statistical association,a nonparametric method for dealing with mismeasured covariate data,a nonparametric method for dealing with mismeasured covariate data,"Abstract Mismeasurement of covariate data is a frequent problem in statistical data analysis. However, when true and mismeasured data are obtained for a subsample of the observations, it is possible to estimate the parameters relating the outcome to the covariate of interest. Maximum likelihood methods that rely on parametric models for the mismeasurement have not met with much success. Realistic models for the mismeasurement process are difficult to construct; the form of the likelihood is often intractable and, more important, such methods are not robust to model misspecification. We propose an easily implemented method that is nonparametric with respect to the mismeasurement process and that is applicable when mismeasurement is due to the problem of missing data, errors in variables, or use of imperfect surrogate covariates. Specifically, denote the outcome variable by Y, the covariate data subject to mismeasurement by X, and the remaining covariates, including perhaps surrogates or mismeasured values ... Collapse"
107396,1991,journal of the american statistical association,nonparametric estimation from cross-sectional survival data,nonparametric estimation from cross sectional survival data,"Abstract In many follow-up studies survival data are often observed according to a cross-sectional sampling scheme. Data of this type are subject to left truncation in addition to the usual right censoring. A number of characteristics and properties of the product-limit estimate, for left-truncated and right-censored data, have been explored and found to be similar to those of the Kaplan-Meier estimate. Under the stationarity assumption, however, it is believed that an alternative estimate has much better efficiency. In this article the conditional maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) property of the product-limit estimate is visited. The non-parametric MLE of the truncation distribution is derived. Use of this estimate includes testing the stationarity assumption, estimating the proportion of truncated data, and other applications in prevalent cohort studies. The analysis of the estimation is based on a “working data” approach. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimates are developed through nonpar... Collapse"

Reneau and Samaniego proposed an estimator Ŝ n for S when S is known as a member of the NBU-t 0 class. Many properties of Ŝ n were studied by Reneau and Samaniego. The problems of the weak convergence of Wn = √n (Ŝ n − S), however, was not solved. In this article, we show that the weak convergence of Wn does not hold in general and establish sufficient conditions for the weak convergence to hold. Three important cases are as follows: (1) If the underlying survival function S is from the subclass of New Strictly Better than Used of age t 0 (e.g., gamma and Weibull distributions), then Wn converges weakly with the same limiting distribution as that of the empirical process. In this case, confidence bands for S can be easily constructed.

107401,1991,journal of the american statistical association,recent developments in nonparametric density estimation,recent developments in nonparametric density estimation,"Advances in computation and the fast and cheap computational facilities now available to statisticians have had a significant impact upon statistical research, and especially the development of nonparametric data analysis procedures. In particular, theoretical and applied research on nonparametric density estimation has had a noticeable influence on related topics, such as nonparametric regression, nonparametric discrimination, and nonparametric pattern recognition. This article reviews recent developments in nonparametric density estimation and includes topics that have been omitted from review articles and books on the subject. The early density estimation methods, such as the histogram, kernel estimators, and orthogonal series estimators are still very popular, and recent research on them is described. Different types of restricted maximum likelihood density estimators, including order-restricted estimators, maximum penalized likelihood estimators, and sieve estimators, are discussed, where restrictions are imposed upon the class of densities or on the form of the likelihood function. Nonparametric density estimators that are data-adaptive and lead to locally smoothed estimators are also discussed; these include variable partition histograms, estimators based on statistically equivalent blocks, nearest-neighbor estimators, variable kernel estimators, and adaptive kernel estimators. For the multivariate case, extensions of methods of univariate density estimation are usually straightforward but can be computationally expensive. A method of multivariate density estimation that did not spring from a univariate generalization is described, namely, projection pursuit density estimation, in which both dimensionality reduction and density estimation can be pursued at the same time. Finally, some areas of related research are mentioned, such as nonparametric estimation of functionals of a density, robust parametric estimation, semiparametric models, and density estimation for censored and incomplete data, directional and spherical data, and density estimation for dependent sequences of observations.

The proposed tests have an interpretation as conditional moment tests and require only the positive Poisson model to be estimated. It is shown that most of the tests for overdispersion in the regular Poisson model given in the econometric and statistical literature can be obtained as special cases of the tests developed in this article.

First, characteristics of the technology used and the process of technical innovation are analyzed. Second, an attempt is made to determine the partial elasticities of substitution for various pairwise combinations of land, labor, fixed capital, and working capital. We find that the technological innovations in Korean agriculture were land and labor saving, fixed capital neutral, and working capital using. Further, we find that working capital was a strong substitute for land and labor in the prewar period and a weak substitute in the postwar period. Fixed capital was a weak substitute for land and labor in the prewar period and a weak complement to land and labor in the postwar period. Finally, working capital and fixed capital were weak substitutes in the prewar period and strong complements in the postwar period. Collapse"

We assume that the urban region produces two goods: a manufactured good and an urban non-traded good, and the rural region also produces two commodities: an agricultural and a rural non-traded good. Our results reveal an asymmetry in the behaviour of the urban and rural regions in response to parametric changes or external shocks. The effects of such changes on the endogenous urban variables are completely determinate. However, the responses of the endogenous variables in the rural region are ambiguous. A deterioration in the terms of trade increases the relative price of the urban non-traded good and increases its output at the expense of the urban traded good. Thus structural adjustment in urban and rural areas may be in opposite directions. Non-regional models of structural adjustment ignore the possibility of having opposite effects in the urban and rural areas. Our results also provide a generalization of the Dutch Disease type phenomenon to a model with migration and unemployment. Collapse"

As a result, in reasonable settings, financial structures which create incentives to expropriate debtholders by increasing risk are shown not to reduce value in an industry equilibrium. Without taxes, capital structure is irrelevant for individual firms despite its effect on the equityholders' incentives, but the maximum total amount of debt in the industry is determinate. Allowing for a corporate tax advantage of debt, capital structure becomes relevant but firms are indifferent between distinct alternative debt levels. Copyright 1991 by American Finance Association.

107527,1991,journal of economics and business,a comparison of the market model and random coefficient model using mergers as an event,a comparison of the market model and random coefficient model using mergers as an event,"Abstract The economic significance of an event under an event study framework depends on how risk of a security is measured in the estimation period. The random coefficient model is an improvement over the traditional market model, because the risk of a security has a random component that is ignored or assumed away in traditional event study literature. In this article, the measure of the risk of a security (beta) is decomposed into systematic and random components. If a random component is identified, then use of the ordinary least squares technique is likely to give misleading estimates of beta coefficients. The random coefficient model does not make the implicit assumption that betas of securities are fixed over time, and consequently it allows for the beta coefficient to have a random component. Estimates with the traditional market model and the random coefficient model are derived by using mergers as an event. Abnormal returns generated under the two models are compared and are consistent with results from earlier merger studies. Collapse"
107533,1991,journal of economic behavior and organization,fairness and efficiency in a collective enterprise,fairness and efficiency in a collective enterprise,"Seminal changes to the Australian industrial relations landscape since the 1980s have had a significant effect on the structure of employment relations and consequently, employee voice regimes. Direct involvement and communication between employer and employees has become the norm as a means to generate employee engagement, loyalty and commitment. How ever, despite the increased variety of alternative voice regimes in Australia, no large scale-survey has been undertaken on joint consultation since 1995. This paper provides an empir ical analysis of employee voice in Australia, w ith a specific focus on joint consultation, draw ing on data from tw o large national surveys of workers. We examine the incidence, composition, purpose and effectiveness of joint consultation from the perspective of employees’, using descriptive statistics. This paper makes a significant empirical contribution to existing know ledge on joint consultation in Australia. INTRODUCTION In recent years, the Australian industrial relations landscape, like many other AngloAmerican countries has been characterised by declining union density, a hostile political and legal environment, decentralised bargaining and the emergence of sophisticated human resource management (HRM) strategies. These changes have had a significant effect on the focus and structure of employment relations and the variety of employee voice regimes in Australia. A major effect has been the shift of decision-making power to the w orkplace, w ith direct communications betw een employers and employees becoming the norm. A significant implication of this change has been the marginalisation of unions and union voice in the workplace, and the development of alternative voice mechanisms, although, in the Australian context, the two are not mutually exclusive. These fundamental changes have stimulated academic interest in individualistic and direct employment relations, non-union voice regimes, high performance work systems and sophisticated HRM practices as w ays to engage employees and manage the employment relationship (e.g. Bryson, 2004). Despite a variety of criticisms of alternative voice mechanisms, including passivity and the negation of the role and legitimacy of unions (Marchington 2001, 1994), it has been shown that cooperative and direct relations based on ‘mutual gains’ between workers and their employers can improve individual w orking lives and organisational performance (Rogers & Streeck 1995). Despite the growth and interest in alternative voice mechanisms, no large-scale survey has been undertaken on joint consultation in Australia since 1995. Given the paucity of research on the topic, and in light of the increasing array of EV channels available in Australian w orkplaces, this paper examines the incidence, composition, purpose and effectiveness of joint consultation from the perspective of employees’. THE DEVELOPMENT OF JOINT CONSULTATION IN AUSTRALIA JCCs emerged in Australia w ith the support of the federal Labor government post-1945, influenced by the success of these mechanisms in other Anglo-A merican countries in facilitating post-w ar productivity and efficiency during reconstruction. JCCs became increasingly common in the public sector but declined by the mid-1950s, due to disillusionment on the part of managers. Disillusionment among managers was linked to staunch resistance by unions who viewed such mechanisms as part of a larger strategy intended to undermine their role and strength in negotiating terms and conditions of employment (e.g. Lansbury 1978). Resistance from unions can only be understood in the context of Australia’s centralised arbitral system which was dominant for most of the 20 century. Under the arbitral system, w ages and conditions w ere set by industrial tribunals through conciliation and arbitration, or, in the shadow of their principles and precedents or the prospect of intervention. The arbitral system also operated on the basis of recognition of organisations, meaning union representation was entrenched as the primary mode of EV. Alternative voice mechanisms resurfaced in the 1970s, under the banner of industrial democracy, although pressure from unions significantly curtailed their scope, leading Lansbury (1978) to argue that workers’ participation was less developed in Australia than any other advanced western economy. Another factor that prohibited the development of alternative voice mechanisms in Australia was the lack of formal power or constitutional basis given to joint consultative bodies. In the absence of legislation regulating JCCs, employers w ere reluctant to relinquish managerial prerogative (e.g. Marchington 1994). The only exception to this situation was the enactment of provisions in the Public Service Reform Act which mandated industrial democracy plans and JCCs in departments and agencies under the jurisdiction of the Public Service Act. Other legislative developments that have influenced the growth of JCCs post 1980 are: w age fixing principles introduced by the national industrial relations tribunal after 1991 that required the parties to industrial aw ards to consult on efficiency and productivity measures; the Termination Change and Redundancy Case (1984), which established a new standard requiring employers to consult on impending change and redundancies; and, requirements for consultation provisions to be included in enterprise agreements under the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 (Cth.) (e.g. Forsyth, Korman & Marshall, 2006). In practice how ever, the lack of legitimacy and authority accorded to JCCs meant that they commonly assumed advisory roles only in Australian workplaces, failing to deal w ith issues of strategic importance. These higher level issues have remained within the scope of collective bargaining between employers and unions, or, within the prerogative of management. The lack of legitimacy accorded to JCCs also provided little impetus or support to spur the workforce to pursue the development of these mechanisms (Davis & Lansbury, 1989). JOINT CONSULTATION AND EMPLOYEE VOICE Little is currently know n about the factors associated w ith the presence and effectiveness of JCCs in Australia. Ramsay’s (1977, 1983) cycles of control theory argues that management interest in employee participation is dependent on the power of unions in the workplace: where unions are stronger, management will use alternative voice regimes such as joint consultation to marginalise union involvement and influence. Marchington’s (1992) w aves’ thesis focuses on micro rather than macro level factors and recognises that these factors may not necessarily be within the realm of management control. Marchington (1992) identifies a paradox of participation: an increase in employee participation in a period of declining organised labour, which he attributes to increasing global competitiveness, and consequently, a variety of demands upon managers to seek continuous improvements in w ork organisation and enhance productivity and efficiency through cooperative practices. Such practices may include: financial involvement, information-sharing and w orkplace flexibility. Poole et al. (1999) put forward a similar argument, identifying four primary factors that explain employee participation: macro economic conditions; the strategic choices of actors; the power of actors; and organisational structures and processes. Recent research on EV and the widespread development of EV mechanisms in practice, also provide rich insights into the nature of participation and potential drivers of joint consultation at the workplace. EV has been linked to: organisational performance, high commitment management and high performance work systems (Boxall & Purcell 2003); employee satisfaction, proactive employee behaviour and industrial democracy (Brewster, Croucher, Wood & Brookes 2007; Budd 2004); and, due process, employee rights and justice in the employment relationship (McCabe & Lewin 1992). Whilst EV is rooted in equity and fairness in the workplace, Hyman (2004) has argued that voice is only one feature of the broader regulation of the employment relationship, meaning that the relative efficacy and sustainability of voice is intertw ined w ith other social and economic features. Dundon et al. (2004) argue a similar case, and both arguments are consistent with Marchington’s (1992) and Poole et al. (1999) frameworks. There is little doubt that the variety of EV mechanisms in Australia and most advanced market economies has increased, resulting in a grow ing heterogeneity of representational and participatory forms. Labour market deregulation, the global decline of organised labour, increased technological sophistication, increased educational levels, widespread industry restructuring and the spread of neo-liberal ideologies have created a favourable environment for the w eakening of collective voice and the subsequent diffusion of direct and non-union voice. The emphasis of the latter is on enhancing productivity and employee commitment rather than industrial democracy (e.g. Brew ster et al. 2007; Bryson 2004). Alternative forms of EV are however, also the result of the increasing emphasis on strategic HRM, and the assumed links between HRM and firm performance under changing organisational and competitive conditions (Wood & Wall 2007). Whilst employee involvement is at the heart of theoretical conceptualisations of HRM as a determinant of firm performance, in practice, EV regimes vary widely in terms of design, employee coverage and the scope of the issues covered: distinctions are commonly made between task-level versus strategic-level decisions (McCabe & Lew in 1992; Dundon et al. 2004). Channels of EV also vary widely in terms of the depth or embeddedness, and recent empirical work has begun to address why employers choose particular forms of voice (e.g. Willman, Bryson and Gomez 2006, 2007; Brewster et al. 2007).

107592,1991,journal of economic literature,clarifying popper,clarifying popper,"Social stress can be understood by incorporating interruption theory as developed in research on stress into a model of identity processes drawn from identity theory. From this perspective, social stress results from interruption of the feedback loop that maintains identity processes. I discuss four mechanisms of interruption of identity processes: broken identity loops, interference between identity systems, over-controlled identity systems, and the invocation of episodic identities. Each of these four mechanisms is associated with conditions known to produce feelings of distress. Finally, I discuss how personal evaluation relates to identity processes and distress, and how distress can lead to changes in identity. T hirty years ago inldentity andAnxiety, Stein, Vidich and White (1960) expressed the concern that the advent of a mass society would lead to a ""loss of identity"" and hence to widespread anxiety or stress. Today, research on social stress is more likely to emphasize the excessive demands and pressures arising from the many roles and identities that people maintain (Holroyd and Lazarus 1982; House 1974). While the implicit contradiction between these contrasting themes of too few or too many identities has not yet been resolved, interest in the relationship between stress or anxiety and identity has grown. In this paper, I propose a model of the relationship between stress and identity. I show that in a variety of situations known to produce stress, stress results from a common mechanism: disruption of the identity process. The importance of this common mechanism is two-fold. First, from the point of view of identity theory, it underlines the importance of understanding identity as a continuous process rather than as a state or trait of an individual. Second, it gives a focus to research on coping and problem solving as mechanisms for dealing with anxiety and distress. While Thoits (1991) has recently suggested that life events related to identities are more likely to produce distress than other life events, the present paper presents a model that helps to clarify this link.

107594,1991,journal of economic literature,productivity and american leadership: a review article,productivity and american leadership a review article,"Background The value of community-based cancer research has long been recognized. In addition to the National Cancer Institute’s Community Clinical and Minority-Based Oncology Programs established in 1983, and 1991 respectively, the National Cancer Institute established the National Cancer Institute Community Cancer Centers Program in 2007 with an aim of enhancing access to high-quality cancer care and clinical research in the community setting where most cancer patients receive their treatment. This article discusses strategies utilized by the National Cancer Institute Community Cancer Centers Program to build research capacity and create a more entrenched culture of research at the community hospitals participating in the program over a 7-year period. Methods To facilitate development of a research culture at the community hospitals, the National Cancer Institute Community Cancer Centers Program required leadership or chief executive officer engagement; utilized a collaborative learning structure where best practices, successes, and challenges could be shared; promoted site-to-site mentoring to foster faster learning within and between sites; required research program assessments that spanned clinical trial portfolio, accrual barriers, and outreach; increased identification and use of metrics; and, finally, encouraged research team engagement across hospital departments (navigation, multidisciplinary care, pathology, and disparities) to replace the traditionally siloed approach to clinical trials. Limitations The health-care environment is rapidly changing while complexity in research increases. Successful research efforts are impacted by numerous factors (e.g. institutional review board reviews, physician interest, and trial availability). The National Cancer Institute Community Cancer Centers Program sites, as program participants, had access to the required resources and support to develop and implement the strategies described. Metrics are an important component yet often challenging to identify and collect. The model requires a strong emphasis on outreach that challenges hospitals to improve and expand their reach, particularly into underrepresented populations and catchment areas. These efforts build on trust and a referral pipeline within the community which take time and significant commitment to establish. Conclusion The National Cancer Institute Community Cancer Centers Program experience provides a relevant model to broadly address creating a culture of research in community hospitals that are increasingly networked via systems and consortiums. The strategies used align well with the National Cancer Institute—American Society of Clinical Oncology Accrual Symposium recommendations for patient-/community-, physician-/provider-, and site-/organizational-level approaches to clinical trials; they helped sites achieve organizational culture shifts that enhanced their cancer research programs. The National Cancer Institute Community Cancer Centers Program hospitals reported that the strategies were challenging to implement yet proved valuable as they provided useful metrics for programmatic assessment, planning, reporting, and growth. While focused on oncology trials, these concepts may be useful within other disease-focused research as well. Collapse"
107595,1991,journal of economic literature,a review of  recursive methods in economic dynamics,a review of recursive methods in economic dynamics,"NANCY STOKEY AND ROBERT LUCAS, JR., and Ed Prescott have produced an exceptionally useful, thorough, and timely introduction to stochastic economic dynamics. Dynamic optimization techniques developed in Operations Research, formulated initially by Richard Bellman (1957), have been used extensively in economics, particularly in macroeconomics, finance, and public finance. Economic theorists have extended dynamic programming theory in several valuable directions. Of particular note for this book is the concept of recursive equilibrium introduced in Edward Prescott and Rajnish Mehra (1980). While these techniques have been used extensively, there has been no broad, unified, and comprehensive presentation of the concepts, tools, and applications of recursive dynamic techniques that is written for economists and demands no more mathematics than a typical student is exposed to in a good graduate program. This book succeeds marvelously in filling this need. Furthermore, given the depth of development, it is also a valuable reference for researchers. Before describing the book's contents in detail, we should discuss what is distinctive and important about the recursive approach to dynamic economic problems. To do this, let's examine a simple problem and an alternative approach to its solution. The canonical problem for economic dynamics is the infinite horizon deterministic growth problem. Let k, be the capital stock at the beginning of period t, f(kt) a neoclassical production function expressing period t production as a function of kt, ct consumption in period t chosen at the end of the period, u(c) a concave utility function, and I the discount factor.

We believe that too few of the profession's resources have been devoted to these issues and that, of those resources that have been employed, too few have been devoted to empirical analyses. We hope that this introductory essay and the three papers that follow will stimulate interest in this subject. This introductory essay first describes some of the basic economic tradeoffs involved in intellectual property law, and then describes the framework of the law in the six areas described above: patent, copyright, semiconductor protection, trademark, trade secret, and misappropriation. It is intended both to provide thumbnail descriptions of the various intellectual property regimes to economists working in this area and to indicate where additional economic research might be useful.

Most economics literature on patenting and patent races has looked at innovations in isolation, without focusing on the externalities or spillovers that early innovators confer on later innovators. But the cumulative nature of research poses problems for the optimal design of patent law that are not addressed by that perspective. The challenge is to reward early innovators fully for the technological foundation they provide to later innovators, but to reward later innovators adequately for their improvements and new products as well. This paper investigates the use of patent protection and cooperative agreements among firms to protect incentives for cumulative research. Collapse"
107598,1991,journal of economic perspectives,a patent system for both diffusion and exclusion,a patent system for both diffusion and exclusion,"Public policy analysis of optimal patent regimes is often framed as a tradeoff between static and dynamic efficiency. In this analytical framework, weak patent protection and strict antitrust policy are taken to be directed toward static concerns, while protection of intellectual property through strong patent laws is taken as a reflection of broader social concerns for long-run growth and technological progress. This characterization has some truth, but the magnitude of the conflict between static and dynamic efficiency, can easily be exaggerated. In this article, I want to argue that weak patent protection need not be inimical to economic growth and, conversely, that strong patent protection need not be an enemy of diffusion. Appropriately structured patent law and antitrust rules can together ensure incentives for R&D and also induce cooperation among firms in diffusing R&D results through licensing and other means. At the same time, cooperation among firms at the R&D stage can counterbalance weak patent protection by internalizing spillovers from ongoing R&D programs, and such cooperation may also produce additional spillovers from the existing knowledge.

No one seemed to notice the tension that was developing between the emerging macroeconomic and microeconomic views of inventories. Macroeconomists routinely thought of inventories as a destabilizing factor, yet the prevailing micro theory viewed inventories as a stabilizing factor. It was a fascinating question that was barely explored. Instead somewhat inexplicably, interest in inventories dried up, as if inventories were of minor economic significance and little intrinsic interest. By the early 1980s, then, economists once again knew something they had known in the 1950s: that inventory investment is of first-order importance in business cycles. But they were also beginning to realize that the standard production-smoothing/buffer-stock model of inventories was in deep trouble. This paper focuses on developments since that realization.

107602,1991,journal of economic perspectives,efficient transportation infrastructure policy,efficient transportation infrastructure policy,"This paper offers a perspective on paying for and investing in the transportation infrastructure. The following example illustrates the need to move away from the current national mind set. Pick any pothole-laden, congested two-lane road in an urban area. Suppose public funds are used to widen the road to four lanes and to repave it. Benefits will immediately flow from this investment in the form of lower travel time and less vehicle damage, but before long, the road will again fill to capacity and deteriorates. This cycle can be broken only if infrastructure is priced and invested in more efficiently. If the pothole-laden road is kept to two lanes when it is repaved but vehicles are required to pay efficient tolls based on congestion and pavement wear, then the road's capacity is far less likely to be exceeded during peak periods and its pavement will remain in good condition. Making efficient use of current transportation capacity will reduce the need for massive public investment in airports and roads and will prevent the recurrence of infrastructure problems. Collapse"

Post Keynesians, following Keynes, have developed a different perspective, where probability distributions are not the basis for comprehending real world behavior under uncertainty. According to this analysis, there are many important situations where ""true"" uncertainty exists regarding future consequences of today's choices. Whenever conditions of true uncertainty prevail, human behavior may differ systematically from what is implied by the standard expected utility perspective. This paper explains how the Post Keynesian perspective differs from the orthodox probability theory approach, thereby providing a more general theory which can explain long-run decisions regarding liquidity demands, investment decisions, the existence of long period underemployment equilibrium, the long-run nonneutrality of money, and the unique and important role Keynes assigned to nominal contracts and especially the money wage contract.

While, such notions are widely held among practicing economists, I want to argue that they are not historically valid. The deployment of mathematical expression in economic discourse enjoyed neither an inexorable nor unhindered progress, but rather was characterized by two primary ruptures in the history of economic thought, episodes marking the inflection points in the rise of mathematical discourse. The main reason for such a disjointed narrative is that, in the evolution of economic thought, most of the participants were not convinced that the subject matter intrinsically demanded mathematical expression, while those so enamored experienced great difficulty in creating a community which could agree upon a formalism which was thought to be well-suited to economic issues.

Although existing research has hardly provided a definitive resolution to this debate (see, for example, Blinder and Deaton 1985, Bernheim 1987, Barro 1989), recent efforts (Feldstein 1982, Kormendi 1983, Aschauer 1985, Leiderman and Razin 1988) have followed Bailey (1971) and broadened the scope of the investigation to include the possibility that government expenditures substitute for private consumption expenditures.

The first of these restrictions is what Feldstein (1982) calls ex ante crowding-out. For complete ex ante crowding-out, government spending on goods and services must substitute dollar-for-dollar for private spending. Consequently, an increase in government expenditures on consumption goods should lead to an equivalent decrease in private consumption expenditures.

The present federal earthquake policy attempts to overcome this indifference through strategies aimed at building local governmental commitment to risk reduction and improving nonfederal capacity to implement risk reduction programs. Because of the fundamental difficulties in influencing actions among less capable and willing jurisdictions, federal efforts have resulted in disjunctive impacts among seismic prone regions. Some “leading” communities have become more prepared, while other “lagging” communities in the same region fall further behind. The preferred approach for overcoming these gaps entails a mix of federally backed earthquake insurance coupled with development of local regulatory standards. More generally, strategies for addressing public risks entail modification of the policy tools for addressing such “private risks” as crime and job-related accidents.

In their model, ""unlimited liability by raising the cost of ownership rights discourages investment in the firm, causing legal firms to be inefficiently small"" (p. 779). The peculiar history of organizational form in the legal profession seemed to provide an opportunity to test their model's prediction. Prior to the 1960s, state law prevented law firms from incorporating, with the effect that unlimited liability was mandated. During the 1960s and early 1970s, a large number of states passed statutes that allowed law and other professional service firms to incorporate, thereby giving such firms the option to elect either an unlimited or a limited liability regime. The result was a universe that included some law firms that were subject to unlimited liability and some that were subject to limited liability. Carr and Mathewson test their model's prediction that law firms would reach a larger, more efficient size under a limited liability regime by using 1972 and 1977 census data to compare firm size based on liability status. Consistent with their model's prediction, they report ""that liability status significantly affects law firm size: a change in liability status from unlimited to limited increases the average law firm size in 1972 (as measured by annual receipts) by approximately $79,000 (in 1972 dollars) or 48 percent.

We agree with the proposition that a major reason motivating states to allow incorporation of law and other professional service firms was to offer to these firms the advantage of superior tax benefits from the corporate form. These tax advantages were related to the areas of pension and profit-sharing plans, group term life insurance, health and accident insurance, medical reimbursement plans, wage continuation plans, and keyman insurance (see Hayes 1978). While tax motives were important, they are not the end of the story. In particular, we do not agree with Gilson that for the period under consideration ""the pattern of law firm incorporation . . . is income tax, not liability, driven"" (p. 421). As this is a factual issue, we illustrate our understanding with a sample of lawyers who have written on this point. Rotgin (1980), a specialist on the professional legal corporation, states that ""one of the principal advantages of the corporate business entity is the concept of limited liability .... While the professional legal corporation also offers attorneys limited liability, this form of limited liability is not as broad in scope as the general corporate limited liability"" (p. 634). Paas (1986) argues that ""the most significant non-tax reason for incorporating a professional practice is to obtain limited liability. Attorneys who incorporate attempt to insulate their personal assets from claims arising in two kinds of cases. First limited liability insulates personal assets from claims arising under the ordinary business debts of the professional corporation .... Second, limited liability bars claims arising out of the professional malpractice of a fellow attorney"" (p. 374). Shores (1974) also argues that ""it would seem that the most significant non-tax factor in favor of incorporating is the substantial reduction in exposure to malpractice liability which normally results in the case of incorporating a group practice"" (p. 711).

Moreover, inflation may increase or decrease the asset duration depending on the rates of inflation growth of asset nominal cash flows and abandonment value and depending on the relaitve benefit of asset abandonment. In additon, the Fisher hypothesis of constant real returns relative to anticipated inflation is also examined in the case of asset abandonment and replacement. The results derived for a single cycle of replacement carry over to the replacement policy in an infinite cycle of replacement. Copyright 1991 by MIT Press. Collapse"

107873,1991,journal of risk and insurance,relevant distributions for insurance prices in an arbitrage free equilibrium,relevant distributions for insurance prices in an arbitrage free equilibrium,"Relevant Distributions for Insurance Prices in an Arbitrage Free Equilibrium The increased volatility of economic and financial-risk factors such as inflation, interest rates, investment returns, and exchange rates during the past decade have forced consideration of more financial factors along with underwriting risk factors in insurance pricing models. Moreover, competition in financial services markets have forced insurers to move more into the financial arena, for example, in terms of products tied to investment performance, discounting of loss reserves, actuarial modeling of investment strategies, hedging interest-rate risks, and the internationalization of insurance operations. As a consequence, some of the research in finance and in risk management and insurance have started to converge as noted by Smith (1986), and Buhlmann (1987). Hence, more of the intertemporal models utilized in insurance and actuarial applications involving financial linkages attempt to incorporate the financial concepts of market efficiency and the equilibrium notions underlying competitive market structures (e.g., Kraus and Ross 1982 and Cummins 1988). The same continuous time, stochastic process models are being used for insurance and asset pricing by scholars in risk management and insurance and by researchers in finance. One reason for this convergence is that insurers have most of their assets in financial instruments (e.g. bonds, stocks and mortgages for life insurance companies and stocks and bonds for property casualty companies) and their liabilities consist of interest sensitive components, such as reserves in both life-health and property-liability insurance which are discounted to a specific valuation date. Consequently, this article analyzes the probabilistic implications of efficiency and equilibrium from the perspective of potential stochastic models pertinent to actuarial calculations or insurance pricing involving financial transactions in an efficient capital market in equilibrium. Intuitively, an efficient capital market is the manifestation of a market system that works in a cost-effective manner, and the study of efficient markets is a study of the (stochastic) process of price formation, or equivalently of the return generating stochastic process, and the market's adjustment to a sequence of relevant information subsets. However, the primitive notion from finance that ""in equilibrium, price efficiency implies that prices reflect all relevant information"" is too general to have any practical quantitative applications for actuarial modeling of insurance products affected by financial prices. To quantitatively formalize and model this intuitive notion of an efficient market, scholars in insurance, actuarial science and finance have developed several approaches to describing the stochastic process of prices. Two of these are the traditional ""independent increments"" or random walk model familiar to actuaries from risk theory, and the more general ""fair game"" or martingale model.(1) Some scholars, such as Cummins (1988), Boyle (1977), Black and Scholes (1972), and Boyle and Schwartz (1977), assume that rates of return, for example on stocks or bonds, follow a Brownian motion process. While there is some empirical support for the implied lognormality of the corresponding prices at any fixed point in time, it would be desirable and preferable to complement this with an economically based theoretical argument showing why such continuous time probability models arise as a consequence of basic economic notions. Grossman and Shiller (1982, p. 197) also appeal for even a further basic economic rationale for the Brownian motion models which they use. The Brownian motion and stochastic calculus models referred to above are widely used in insurance and actuarial research, for example see: Emanuel, Harrison and Taylor (1975), Boyle (1977), Martin-Lof (1986), Cummins (1988), and Sharp (1989). … Collapse"

Insofar as risk-taking behavior is purposive, social scientists have predicted that technological progress may be negated by various forms of “risk compensation.” The validity of this hypothesis is tested in the transportation sector with data from the U.S. on the effects of new mandatory safety-belt-use laws. A fixed-effects model of traffic fatality counts is estimated using pooled data from 50 states during the 1975–1987 period. Results suggest that such laws have reduced mortality among car occupants to a degree that is compatible with the predictions of technologists. However, there is weak evidence of increased mortality among some nonoccupants, a pattern predicted by risk-compensation theorists. The lifesaving effects of belt-use laws are largest in states that permit primary police enforcement and appear to be somewhat larger for front-seat occupants age 21 and under. Although offsetting behavior appears to be small relative to lifesaving effects, it may take several more years for any compensatory behavior to achieve a new equilibrium. Collapse"

The research was made upon two samples of respondents, juvenile delinquents who were sanctioned by the juvenile courts in Republic of Croatia for some offense: first sample consisted of 4056 of those who were sanctioned during the period of five years (1987. - 1991.), which is in this paper related to as the pre-war period, while the second sample consisted of 2870 of those who were sanctioned during the period of seven years (1995. - 2001.), which is in this paper described as the post-war period. The statistics show that the number of the juveniles sanctioned during the post-war period significantly reduced in relation to the pre-war period. Part of the explanation for this lies in the well-elaborated post-war policy of solving the problems of upbringing and family relation out of the court. However, the behavior features between the above mentioned two groups have shown statistically significant differences. Post-war generation has shown significantly harder 'profile' (more violent offenses, recidivism, asocial behaviors, addictions and problems in the educational process). The paper suggests a reform for the institutions which are conducting correctional measures and the sanction of juvenile prison, with the goal of adjusting to the new situation - the 'profile' of juvenile delinquents is becoming harder, while the systems responsible for their treatment are changing too slowly, removing too slowly from the principles upon which they worked before the war.

The results underscore the importance of distinguishing between the short and long run effects particularly for groups like milk and meat. The demand for intake of nutrients is next analysed using two time observations on individuals under three formulations. A simple dynamic demand system is specified for five nutrient groups which is then extended to incorporate the differences in quality of foods consumed by expressing the intake of nutrients as ratios to energy intake by the individuals. Lastly, an interdependent formulation is estimated under special assumptions on the pattern of correlation between the individual effects and the remaining nutrients. The limited length of the panel data raises some issues of identification in the third case that are also resolved. Overall, these data provide support for the view that increases in household incomes will in turn improve the intakes of nutrients. Collapse"
107919,1991,journal of urban economics,capitalization of local income taxes,capitalization of local income taxes,"About 25 years ago, people were singing of the dawning of a new age--the ""Age of Aquarius,"" from the Broadway musical Hair. Peace, tranquility and ""people power"" were on everyone's lips. As the United States enters the final decade of the century, not only may we be experiencing a rebirth of ""Aquarius,"" as rapidly chaning world events have shown, but we also are seeing the dawning of yet another new age--a decade of higher taxes. The year 1991 may be remembered for many things, but in the world of taxes it will be seen as the beginning of a period that will affect taxpayers' pocketbooks for many years to come. This article is intended as a reminder of what is new and different in 1991 as well as pointing out some continuing areas that deserve special scrutiny. With the ""maturity"" of tax laws such as the Tax Reform Act of 1986, nontraditional taxes and tougher guidelines, attempts are being made to broaden the tax base. Combine this with state and local governments' financial needs and many taxpayers may soon return to a top marginal tax rate approaching or exceeding 40% (combined federal, state and local). STATE AND LOCAL TAX PRESSURES The pressure on state and local governments to raise money has never been greater. Connecticut recently adopted its first-ever state income tax after a long battle. Other states, including New York and New Jersey, missed their fiscal year budget deadlines by a wide margin as they wrangled over ways to raise revenue. And local governments aren't without their problems. Bridgeport, Connecticut, declared bankruptcy. New York City raised income tax rates to make up for a huge budget shortfall that led to thousands of municipal employee layoffs. This means practitioners can't consider just federal income tax rates anymore in doing client tax planning. Consider the case of New York City residents. Exhibit 1, page 75, shows the federal tax and the total tax (federal, state and local) for a New York City taxpayer under four different scenarios, for the years 1986 and 1991. The substantial increase in the marginal rate from 1986 to 1991, despite a drop in federal tax rates, dramatically illustrates the role state and local taxes play in overall planning. WHAT'S NEW AND DIFFERENT FOR 1991 Many things have changed for 1991 as a result of the phase in of past legislation as well as changes enacted last year. For a summary of last-minute tax reminders, see the sidebar on page 76. Tax rates. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliations Act of 1990 (OBRA) modified 1991 personal rates. The new rates, adjusted for indexing, are shown in exhibit 2, page 78. How else will tax rates change? The old 33% ""bubble"" was dropped and a new 31% bracket added. As before, brackets will be indexed annually for inflation. Because of the exemption phaseout and loss of some itemized deductions for those with adjusted gross incomes (AGIs) above $100,000 (explained below), the top marginal rate for some taxpayers could be as high as 34%. Alternative minimum tax (AMT). THe AMT rate was increased from 21% to 24%. For details, see page 78. Capital gains tax. The top rate for capital gains has been set at 28%. There are some special rules with which practitioners should become familiar. Schedule D of form 1040 (August 1991 proof) has been changed to provide an area for calculating the capital gains tax. PHASEOUTS The ""phaseout"" era (1987 to 1990) created by the 1986 act has finally come to an end. Among the affected items not deductible in 1991 are * Personal or consumer interest, such as that on auto loans, tuition loans, credit card or store accounts, personal loans, etc. * Investment interest paid in excess of net investment income. The current deduction is limited to net investment income; however, unused investment interest can be carried over to subsequent years. Investment interest expenses related to passive activity losses (PALs) remain subject to such rules. … Collapse"

107921,1991,journal of urban economics,the highway speed-volume relationship revisited,the highway speed volume relationship revisited,"The highway speed-volume relationship has been studied by a number of authors, and is an important issue in urban transportation. Estimates of the relationship may be used to examine congestion externalities, calculate optimal tolls, and calibrate traffic simulation models. A recent paper in this journal by Fare, Grosskopf, and Yoon [2; hereafter referred to as FGYI views highways as a production process, with flow of cars and highway scale representing inputs, and speed representing the output. FGY then present a functional speed-flow relationship grounded in production theory. In addition to the basis in production theory, FGY observe that their function is consistent with the law of variable proportions. FGY state that, unlike most other specifications that have been employed, their function is able to describe the characteristic speed-volume relationship where speed increases with volume over a range of low volume, attains a maximum, then decreases with volume. Unfortunately, as shown below, the parameter estimates presented by the authors are incorrect, due to the authors’ use of faulty software. In addition, FGY incur some minor problems in their application, which are also addressed below. Nonetheless, with some minor adjustments, the production theory approach to the speed-volume relationship remains appealing and useful. FGY begin with a general, short-run production function of the form G = g(x, N), where G represents common speed of vehicles, x > 0 represents fixed highway scale, and N E R, is defined as the flow of cars in a lane past a fixed point. This short-run production function is required to satisfy several properties of production functions listed by FGY. In Eq. (2.3) of their paper, FGY present the function Collapse"

The operator's benefit from travel pass sales is increased revenues, given that the combination of passes and single tickets allows second degree price discrimination based on the intensity of transit usage. This paper sheds light on a less advantageous property of travel passes in the presence of crowding discomfort externalities: zero marginal fare with non-zero marginal external cost lead to inevitable overconsumption. The authors derive from a microeconomic model and a numerical simulation that in crowding the revenue generating power of travel passes diminishes. Under severe capacity constraints the availability of travel passes may reduce social welfare and harm profits as well; the authors reach this general conclusion without restrictive assumptions on optimal economic behavior in price setting.

108013,1991,monthly labor review,state workers' compensation:  legislation enacted in 1990,state workers compensation legislation enacted in 1990,"Workers' compensation programs provide protection to workers a and their families. The programs compensate for lost wages and medical expenses incurred as a result of work-related injuries or illnesses. Survivor benefits are also provided when the disabilities result in death. In 1991, about $16.11 billion in medical benefits and $25.3 billion in wage-loss compensation was paid in settlement of claims filed for disabled or deceased workers. These benefits were paid by private carriers, by State funds, or by self-insuring companies as determined by laws in each State. The employer's cost of providing workers' compensation coverage generally varies according to risk, industrial classification, and experience rating. Nationally, such costs were approximately 2.4 percent of payroll or about $590 for each of the 93.6 million protected employees. This article examines the recent changes in coverage, in benefit levels, and in employer costs and the factors influencing such changes. Over the past decade, workers' compensation benefits have increased by 157 percent and employer costs by 143 percent. In the same period, the number of covered employees has risen 22 percent and the amount of covered wage and salary payroll, 77 percent. Payments to beneficiaries covered under workers' compensation programs in the United States rose more than 10 percent to $42.2 billion between 1990 and 1991, the eighth consecutive year of double-digit increases. Premium costs to employers rose by less than 4 percent to $55.2 billion in the same period, while the number of workers covered under the various State and Federal programs decreased to 93.6 million, a decline of 1.6 percent from 1990. This drop reflected a similar decline in the total work force, and the proportion of covered workers remained about the same at 87 percent of all wage and salary workers. The workers' compensation program provides medical care, hospitalization benefits, and income-maintenance protection to workers whose disabilities are the result of work-related injuries or illnesses. The income-maintenance benefits are intended as partial replacement for lost wages. The program also provides survivor benefits to the dependents of deceased works whose deaths result from job-related accidents and/or occupational diseases. Before the enactment of workers' compensation laws, an injured worker could recover damages only if he or she could establish that the incident was due to the negligence of the employer. Currently, proof of employer negligence is not a prerequisite for benefit payment. As the workers' compensation system grows, it continues to be of significant interest to administrators of the Social Security system because both are programs that provide for payments to disabled workers and to the survivors of workers. The 1965 Amendments to the Social Security Act provide for a reduction in Social Security payments so that total benefits under both programs do not exceed the higher of either 80 percent of a worker's former earnings or the total family benefit under Social Security.(1) The gaps and overlaps in coverage and the benefits and costs incurred under both the Social Security and workers' compensation programs are vital considerations in the effective implementation of the Social Security program. The Federal Act of 1908 was the first workers' compensation law in the United States. This legislation provided limited benefits for certain Federal employees engaged in hazardous work. By 1911, workers' compensation legislation had been enacted in nine States and, by 1920, all but seven States had established such programs. However, it was not until 1949 that all States had programs to furnish income-maintenance protection. Today, workers' compensation consists of separate programs in 50 States and the District of Columbia, and two Federal programs: the Federal Employees Compensation Act covering civilian Federal Government employees and the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act covering longshore and harbor workers. … Collapse"
108014,1991,monthly labor review,changes in unemployment insurance legislation during 1990,changes in unemployment insurance legislation during 1990,"New Federal legislation made all States eligible to provide temporary emergency unemployment compensation benefits, financed entirely by Federal funds, for 13 or 20 additional weeks to unemployed workers who had exhausted their benefits. The emergency benefits program is effective from November 17, 1991, to June 13, 1992. Liberalized provisions were also included for ex-Servicemembers, nonprofessional school employees, and railroad workers. This legislation is Public law 102-164, as amended, enacted on November 15 and December 4, 1991, respectively. On February 7, 1992, further legislation was enacted (Public law 102-244) that extended the expiration date of emergency benefits from June 13 to July 4, 1992, and provided an additional 13 weeks of federally funded benefits to workers eligible under Public Law 102-164, as amended. In the 1970's, a permanent Federal-State program of extended benefits was established for workers who exhaust their entitlement to regular State benefits during periods of high unemployment. The program is financed equally from Federal and State funds. Extended benefits are ""triggered"" into effect when a State's unemployment rate among insured workers averages 5 percent or more over a 13-week period and is at least 20 percent higher than the rate for the same period in the two preceding years. If the insured unemployment rate reaches 6 percent, a State may by law disregard the 2-percent requirement in initiating extended benefits. Once triggered, extended benefit provisions remain in effect for at least 13 weeks. When a State's benefit period ends, extended benefits to individual workers also end--even for workers who have received less than their potential entitlement and are still unemployed. Further, once a State's benefit period ends, another Statewide period cannot begin for at least 13 weeks. Most eligibility conditions for extended benefits and the amount of weekly benefits payable are determined by State law. However, under Federal law, a claimant applying for extended benefits must have had 20 weeks in full-time employment (or the equivalent in insured wages) and must meet special work requirements. A worker who has exhausted his or her regular benefits is eligible for a 50-percent increase in duration of benefits for a maximum of 13 weeks of extended benefits. There is, however, an overall maximum of 39 weeks of regular and extended benefits, Extended benefits are payable at the same rate as the weekly amount under the regular State program. (For a more comprehensive overview of the unemployment insurance program, see ""Social Security Programs in the United States,"" Social Security Bulletin, September 1991, pp. 20-28). 1991-92 LEGISLATION Because of the way extended benefits are triggered into effect, only nine jurisdictions qualified for them during the economic downturn of 1991: Alaska, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia. Thus, there was broad interest in considering legislation to change how the extended benefits program is activated. The extended benefits program is based on the insured unemployment rate (IUR)--the number of unemployed workers eligible for benefits in a State as a percent of the number of persons in unemployment-insurance covered employment in that State. By definition, the IUR does not include workers who have exhausted their benefits but are still unemployed. It was thought that the IUR worked well until the proportion of unemployed persons receivirig unemployment insurance dropped well below 100 percent--to about percent. Another problem with the IUR is that it has the effect of deactivating extended benefits in a State when substantial numbers of workers are exhausting their benefits, which reduces insured unemployment and therefore the IUR. To correct this situation, Congress considered legislation that would base extended benefits on the total unemployment rate (TUR), rather than the insured unemployment rate. … Collapse"

While overall these indexes are related to each other in a statistical sense, there are sufficient differences among them to impact the rankings of the individual countries. Because the liberty indicators currently available for use are fairly coarse, the differences that these weighting techniques yield in the summary liberty indexes are understated. As research on liberty yields finer measures of the liberty indicators, the choice of the weighting technique will become more crucial in defining an overall measure of economic liberty. As Table 3 indicates, the simple overall ranking index we created summarizes the information content of all the other indexes (based on hedonic, data variance, etc. rationale) and appears to be very robust with respect to all of them. In addition, all the rankings indicate that economic growth and RGDP are positively correlated with the level of economic liberty within a nation. Collapse"

Even when the efficiency aspects of redistribution are not considered, there is no way in which the final distribution of incomes could be equal if the initial distribution of incomes were unequal!The role of political parties in this model is to manipulate the distribution of political chances in order to maximize their probability of winning elections. I show for instance that “social instability” and progressive redistribution characterize the equilibrium outcome of a two-class democracy in which the lower class forms a majority. Collapse"
108096,1991,public choice,collusion and rent-seeking,collusion and rent seeking,"F rom independence and till the early 1990s, the Indian economy was characterised by a command and control regime, whereby the state essentially shaped the investment decisions of the private sector and the public sector occupied the 'commanding heights' of the economy. Most commentators are of the view that such a dirigiste regime led to a collusive and rent-seeking relationship between the state and the private sector, and that this had significant negative impacts on economic performance. There were signs even in the early 1980s that the attitude of the Indian state towards the private sector was changing. In 1991, the Indian economy underwent major economic reforms, and the command and control regime was dismantled. Along with this, there was a clear shift in the Indian state away from a hostile relationship with the business sector, towards a closer and more collaborative relationship with private capital. However, given India's federal structure and the significant political autonomy and independence in legislative powers enjoyed by state governments, the evolution of state-business relations (SBRs) has not been the same across Indian states, with more collaborative relationships forming in some states and not in others. Has this change in the nature of SBRs in Indian states, from a collusive to a more collaborative relationship, had any impact on economic growth? Strikingly, although economic growth in India has been strong since the mid-1980s, not all regions in India have benefited equally from the improvement in overall economic performance. States like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have grown at a rate of per capita income that has exceeded 4.5% per annum during the period. On the other hand, states such as Assam, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh have grown at around 2% or less in the same period. These variations in economic growth across states in India have been strongly correlated with poverty declines in India, with high and persistent rates of poverty in states such as Assam and Bihar as compared with Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. Improving Institutions for Pro-Poor Growth (IPPG) research has shown that variations in regional institutional quality captured by the quality or effectiveness of SBRs can explain variations in economic growth in Indian states. Cali et al. (2009) measure the nature of SBRs in India across states and over the period 1975-2004.

Kuna sellesse ajajarku jaab Eesti iseseisvuse taastamine, toimusid olulised muutused ka Eesti teatrites, mis selgelt kajastuvad ka repertuaari kujundamises. Totalitaarriigi normeeringutest 1991. aastal vabanenud kultuuriorganisatsioonid pidid kohanema turumajanduse tingimustes toimiva uhiskonnaga. Samuti toimusid 21. saj alguses olulised muutused kunstide arengus: uhelt poolt kunstilise koodi komplitseerumine, teisalt kunsti kokkusulamine meelelahutustoostusega, samuti referentsgruppide areng ning kultuuri uhiskondliku positsiooni muutumine. Artikli teoreetiliseks aluseks on Hollandi kultuuriteoreetiku Hans van Maaneni teos „How to Study Art Worlds” (2009). The article examines the factors which shaped the repertoire of Estonian theatres from 1986–2006. Estonian society was during this period stepping from one social formation into another, from the era of the ESSR (Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic) to the epoch of the newly regained independence of the Estonian Republic. Important changes were under way in Estonian theatres as well, being clearly reflected in the repertoire development. Under the totalitarian regime, the theatre repertoire was naturally subjected to all-round ideological control in the equal forms of preliminary and repressive censorship. All items of the planned repertoire had to pass the joint preliminary censorship of the Ministry of Culture, Glavlit (General Directorate for the Protection of State Secrets in the Press and the Central Committee of the Estonian Communist Party); the finished production underwent a thorough scrutiny as well. With several of the more provocative producers, obtaining a permit to perform in front of the audience could be a long and multi-stage process because at each closed rehearsal the censors discovered new ideological “mistakes”. In the most extreme cases (Merle Karusoo’s student production “Full Rooms”, 1982), the production was not allowed on stage. In such a political period, it would have been unthinkable to use the form of devising theatre, which has by today become fairly common, where the preparation of a production does not start with the search for ways of interpretation of the written play, but the text to be performed will be ready (often, in collaboration with the actors) by the first night, and some parts of the text (or all of it) can be freely ad-libbed at the performances. In 1991, the cultural organisations of the independent Estonia had to change thoroughly their previous order of work. On the one hand – the censorship that had restricted creative work had been done away, and the paperwork required by the Ministry had lessened. In the first decade of the 21st century, the majority of Estonian theatres were reorganised into state foundations, which allowed them sovereignty in making their creative work-related decisions. On the other hand, the state financial support for theatres diminished considerably and the theatres were forced to increase their own earnings. This task was made even more complicated by the global developments in culture and economics. The postmodernist fragmentary view of the world “pushes” the theatre, which had become a cultural phenomenon of crucial importance during the period of the ESSR, into a more marginal position. The interest of especially the younger generation is rather focussed on other genres of art – film, music – and on all the genres that are closely related to the emergence of new media channels. As important is the widening of travel opportunities related to the opening of state borders, leading the Estonian theatre into a direct competition with the world theatre. In the local context, the theatre has to compete with all other cultural and entertainment institutions (cinemas, night clubs, sports clubs, other hobby clubs) for people’s free time. An important factor is also the burst of social activities in the second half of the 1980s and the highly emotional background of the (re)creation of the new state as well as the economic crisis of the early 1990s, which channelled the attention of people and society more on the topics of economic policies. The priorities seen in the repertoire of Estonian theatres at the end of the period under discussion (2001–2006) testify that equal stress was laid on the economic considerations (meeting the interests of potential target groups), new aesthetic pursuits, and on the wish to voice their opinion on Estonian social processes and to move synchronously with the ongoing processes in the world of theatre. We need to pay special attention to important changes in the development of the arts in the early 21st century on the complexity of artistic code, the primacy of conceptualism, the withdrawal of coherence and emergence of associativeness and fragmentariness. In the context of theatre development, we could primarily talk about the marginalisation of narrativity and clear message as well as the important changes regarding the aesthetics of directing, acting and theatre space. In some cases, these changes in the Estonian theatre may have been so abrupt (in order to achieve synchronicity and to join the paradigms of the Western European contemporary exploratory theatre) that a noticeable part of the audience could not relate to what the stage offered. In a longer perspective, the result of such a communication block may be that certain spectator groups would drift away from the theatre and in turn reducing the numbers of the audience, but also marginalising the social context of the theatre. As the first remedy, the theatres would increase the share of more entertaining repertoire, which can only partly be justified. In the second half of the 1990s, we can see another renaissance of Estonian original plays (Madis Koiv, Andrus Kivirahk, Jaan Tatte), as well as the growing interest of the public in new interpretations of the works of the Estonian classics. The boom of summer productions refers on one hand to the fact that the theatre is becoming a part of the entertainment industry and internal tourism, but on the other hand, among the summer productions are several significant and artistically solid works that remain in the history of the Estonian theatre. The aesthetic development of the Estonian theatre moves together with its organisational changes. New, smaller and more mobile theatres emerge and prove to be sustainable, identifying with some smaller reference groups of the audience (Theatrum, Von Krahl). At the same time, Estonia has inherited from the former regime several theatre buildings with large halls seating 500–700 people. “Filling” these halls, especially in smaller cities (Tartu, Parnu, Viljandi, Rakvere) proved to be a difficult task for the theatres in these cities. The present article is theoretically based on the book How to Study Art (2009) by the Dutch theorist Hans van Maanen, who sees the act of cultural communication in close functional relations fitting the creation, production, interpretation, communication, reception and the wider cultural and socio-economics of the work into a single integrated system. The notional lines of force, determining the resulting twelve subspaces, shape different socio-cultural processes and the birth process of a work of art starting from the moment of its emergence up to the possibilities for reshaping the reality. In the context of the theatre, this line could begin with the elementary preconditions for the emergence of creative inspiration (existence of the theatre tradition, theatre buildings, existence of professional actors and stage directors and potential audiences) and end with the complicated processes occurring in the sensory organs of the audience members. The main part of the article deals with the transposing of the stages, presented in Maanen’s discussion, onto the development of the repertoire politics (which can be treated as an independent subspace) of Estonian theatres during twenty years, and with identifying its strategic focal points: which levers (aesthetic, economic, political) have been prevalent in the choices made by theatres? Who (theatre administrators or other institutions) have been behind these choices? How much have these choices been influenced by the profile, location and ownership form of the theatre? How has the process of shaping the repertoire changed in twenty years? Collapse"

But just as the conduct of ostensibly charitable hospitals cannot be examined independently of the interests of the physicians who staff them, so too, we think, the conduct of public-health bureaus should not be examined in isolation from the interests of the medical community that they represent. An interest-group interpretation of public health would look to the ways in which public-health processes increase the aggregate demand for medical services, thereby generating quasirents for specialized input suppliers.

While the USSR existed, characterized by the uniformity of its political, economic, social, and cultural order, there was little incentive, apart from personal interest, for social scientists to specialize in their research on any of its component republics, including the Ukrainian SSR, and there was also no incentive to teach about them at universities. Hence there was a dearth of scholarly work on Soviet Ukraine from a social-scientific perspective. The exceptions, all but one of them emigres—Jurij Borys, Bohdan Krawchenko, Bohdan R. Bociurkiw, Peter J. Potichnyj, Wsevolod Isajiw, and David Marples—were all the more notable.

108105,1991,public choice,fed behavior in periods of price and wage controls,fed behavior in periods of price and wage controls,"There is a literature which addresses the bureaucratic behavior and incentives of the Federal Reserve System. Some of the papers along these lines include Acheson and Chant (1973), Kane (1980), Levy (1981), Toma (1981), Friedman (1982), Shughart and Tollison (1983), and Allen (1986). This paper brings to bear some additional evidence on the behavior and the incentives of the Fed. In particular, we examine the behavior of the Fed during periods of price and wage controls. The public-interest approach to Fed behavior suggests that the Fed should pursue a monetary policy that is consistent with price and wage controls in order to control inflationary forces. The private-interest approach suggests that price and wage controls make seigniorage operations more profitable for the Fed and make it more difficult for Fed overseers to monitor Fed performance, in both cases leading the Fed to pursue monetary expansion in its own self-interest during a period of price and wage controls. The setting of price and wage controls, therefore, provides a test of public- versus private-interest hypotheses about Fed behavior. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops the competing explanations of Federal Reserve behavior. Section 3 presents the estimates of a structural, money-supply reaction function and an ARIMA/transfer function model of Fed behavior, in each case controlling for ceteris paribus conditions and periods of wage and price controls. The results of both models indicate a falsification of the public-interest explanation of Fed policy. Section 4 offers some concluding remarks. Collapse"
108106,1991,public choice,committees in legislatures:  a property rights perspective,committees in legislatures a property rights perspective,"Legislative organization in the face of uncertain policy outcomes has been investigated from the perspective of signaling models in which an informed committee reports a bill and the legislature then amends, enacts, or rejects the bill. As the political principal, however, the legislature could take the lead rather than react to the work of its agent. This article presents a new theory of legislative organization with informational committees in which the legislature as the principal explicitly structures its arrangement with a committee before the committee begins its legislative work. The theory provides a number of quite different predictions. For example, in the signaling theory a closed rule can create stronger incentives for specialization by a moderate committee than an open rule, whereas in this theory an open rule provides stronger incentives. Moreover, the legislature prefers to structure the arrangement with the committee rather than simply react to its efforts. egislatures such as the U.S. Congress are self-organizing in the sense that they choose their internal organization and develop procedures and norms under which they operate. A central theme in the legislative organization literature is that, as in other forms of work, there are gains from the division of labor and specialization through committees. Specialization can be particularly important when policies have uncertain outcomes. The desire to avoid uncertainty and make informed policy choices provides a rationale for establishing committees that specialize in policy areas and develop information that can be used in writing legislation. Political institutions, however, have limited means of generating incentives for informational specialization. They cannot grant property rights, enter into contracts enforceable by a third party, or explicitly pay for performance.1 A legislature's principal instruments for providing incentives are grants of parliamentary advantage, resources that lower the costs of specialization and committee work, and rewards to committee members for their work. In their seminal research on legislative organization, Gilligan and Krehbiel (1987, 1989a, 1989b, 1990; Krehbiel 1991) studied the relationship between a parent legislature and a committee that specializes by obtaining private information about policy outcomes.2 In developing their theory Gilligan and Krehbiel use a legislative signaling model in which an informed committee moves first by reporting a bill followed by the parent legislature taking a final passage vote possibly after amendments. In contrast to the signaling approach, a legislature need not wait passively for a committee to report a bill. Instead, a legislature can choose its internal organization before it and its committees begin their work. To the extent it has instruments at its disposal to structure the work of the committee, the legislature gains by moving first rather than waiting for the committee to act. As the political principal in the relationship, the legislature thus would be expected to take the lead rather than be passive with respect to the work of its agent.

108108,1991,public choice,does duration of political control matter?  interstate differences in branch-banking laws,does duration of political control matter   interstate differences in branch banking laws,"ConclusionsThis study began by trying to explain differences in state branch-banking regulations. Introducing a variable that captures the effect of political dominance over time improves upon the commonly used measures of political dominance at a specific point in time. Even the direct comparison with the previously used percentage point-in-time variables shows that duration of political influence matters significantly. No matter which party is in control, the length of time it has been in control in a state influences political outcomes. We show that, in terms of which kind of legislation will be enacted, Democratic and Republican control exert equal but opposite effects on legislative results. In other words, length of control matters independently of party affiliation, but party affiliation affects the nature of the outcome of the political process.This new approach might be useful in different areas of the public choice literature. For example, it could be applied to analyzing how abortion laws vary across states. Other areas of economics might benefit as well from considering the duration of control. For example, the political business cycle literature, as in Alesina and Sachs (1988), Golden and Poterba (1980), Hibbs (1977) and Hawthorne and Jackson (1987), that examines patterns in macroeconomic policies and outcomes associated with the kind of government in power, might well be improved by including duration as well as direction of control. In general, any area of public economics in which the effects of political power are considered would benefit from considering the duration as well as the incidence of that power. Collapse"
108109,1991,public choice,"the provocative public sector:  domestic political protest and public sector growth in the oecd, 1965-1982",the provocative public sector   domestic political protest and public sector growth in the oecd  1965 1982,"Summary of resultsThe results shown in Tables 1 through 8 above are consistent in that %GG is repeatedly shown to be significant whether making cross-national comparisons of DPP or predicting intra-national variations over time. Therefore, Hypotheses 1a and 1b are confirmed. The confirmation of Hypotheses 2a and 2b shows that, taking into account public sector size, government growth is most provocative in countries where it represents a major socio-economic change (i.e., where the public sector is small). Government growth has a neutral impact where the role of the public sector is long-established (i.e., where the public sector is large).Hypotheses 3a and 3b posited that average and annual rates of economic growth would be inversely associated with domestic protest. These hypotheses, too, were confirmed. The belief that economic growth rates would clearly provide the margin of affordability for public sector growth was not confirmed, as the coefficient of the interaction term (%GG*%GDP) was not statistically significant.Hypotheses 4a and 4b suggested a positive association between public sector visibility and DPP. The data yielded contrary results: more visible public sectors' growth is associated with less protest, and less visible public sectors' growth is associated with more protest. Hypotheses 4a and 4b are not confirmed.Overall, these findings for the OECD countries conform quite closely those of Cuzan et al. (1988) in their analysis of Iberic-Latin countries. In both studies, public sector growth emerges as a significant factor positively affecting protest, while public sector size and average economic growth are inversely related to average protest.In seeking to link political protest to governments' fiscal actions, this study has found that public sector growth is positively associated with the level of expressed discontent in advanced Western market economies, notably so when the public sector is relatively small. 77% of the cross-national variation and 47% of the annual variation in DPP was explained, confirming the importance of including fiscal indicators among the causes of anti-government protest. That these conclusions are drawn from highly aggregated data implies that a narrowed focus will yield a finer understanding of the relationships.The present results clearly suggest that slower public sector growth and positive GDP growth are linked to a lower incidence of DPP. Thus, we could expect that protest has declined after 1982, a period marked by fiscal restraint and renewed economic growth across the OECD. Further, as the countries with smaller public sectors approach the other OECD countries' average public sector size, their rates of government growth can be expected to slow. Analysis of future public sector and protest data may then indicate that the impact of government growth is neutral, as in the case of countries with larger public sectors in this study. However, protest will not diminish altogether as public sectors expansion ends. Public sector growth explains variations from normal levels of protest attributable to other social, political, and economic effects.What has made the public sector provocative during the time period examined here is change. Public sector growth in the OECD countries has represented the reordering of the means of control of the economy and the polity. It has thus been associated with the domestic political protest that has accompanied the profound changes in Western industrial societies from the 1960s through the 1980s. Collapse"

The main theme of this Symposion was the confrontation of an important hypothesis of the New Economic History with empirical evidence from selected periods of history. The hypothesis, which the editors call the Kant-Gibbon-WeberNorth hypothesis, is about the role of institutional competition as a decisive factor for shaping economic development and fostering economic growth of nations. It has been put forward, in particular, for the explanation of the ""European Miracle"" (Eric Jones) and says that the struggle for survival among the fragmented European political units, accentuated by changes in military technology, forced rulers to seek more and stable revenue by undertaking credible commitments to restrain their self-serving inclination to arbitrarily seize assets. Competition for mobile factors of production such as qualified human capital and loanable funds for investment compelled the state to bind its coercive power by securing private property rights and respecting impersonal rules of just conduct. Continuous shackling of arbitrary behavior of rulers in their relationships with merchants, entrepreneurs, and the citizen in general promoted, in particular, the evolution of efficient capital markets and risk spreading thus making innovation, production, and trade more profitable. Owing to the unprecedented growth in scale and scope of economic activity, eventually wide sections of the population got the only real chance to escape poverty and destitution. This sketch of the Kant-GibbonWeber-North hypothesis makes it clear that the hypothesis can also be seen as pattern prediction of a specific interplay between institutional and economic evolution. Elaborating this pattern prediction, the papers and comments are divided into ""Part I: Theory"" (pp. 3-81) and ""Part II: Case Studies"" (pp. 83-304), dealing with ""The Rise of Nations"" and, less extensively, with their ""Decline"". In addition to the editors' ""Introduction and Overview"", the theoretical part contains three commented papers. The opening paper by Douglas C. North provides a short account of his view of ""The Rise of the Western World"". To begin with, he asks the question why it happened that throughout history (and even in much of the modern world) societies have failed to make the ""proper"" investments by which they could reasonably expect to reach a sustainable path of innovation and growth. His answer diagnoses a fundamental kind of institutional failure (p. 13): Collapse"

The model is still subject to the general criticism frequently advanced against the use of dual models, though, since full adjustment of inputs is assumed (see, e.g., Johnston, 1984: 336–337).

108113,1991,public choice,a note on the electorate's most preferred inflation rate,a note on the electorates most preferred inflation rate,"Nordhaus (1975) and MacRae (1977) have articulated theories of the political business cycle which allow one to estimate an inflation rate that is optimal in the sense that it will maximize the chance of a political party remaining in power. Central to the notion of a political business cycle is a preference function or iso-vote loss curve which reflects the willingness of the electorate to endure extra unemployment for the sake of a lower inflation rate. The authors assume that this tradeoff function is well behaved and can be approximated by a parabola or half circles. The electorate's most preferred inflation rate can be defined as that rate which will maximize the chance of an incumbent political party getting reelected for any possible variation in the unemployment rate. It is also the inflation rate which would presumably prevail in a democratic society if unemployment were not a problem. In constructing their voter preference curves involving a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment Nordhaus and MacRae both assumed that price stability, other things equal, is preferred by the electorate to either inflation or deflation. Alan Greenspan, has indicated that he and other governors of the Federal Reserve share this view and are willing to support a bill sponsored by Representative Stephen Neal which would require the Fed to pursue polices aimed at eliminating inflation within five years (Wessel, 1989). When parabolas representing a non ""turnover contour"" curve are fit to the election year inflation and unemployment rates which encompass all those cases where the incumbent political party did not loose the presidential election, however, the conclusion is that the most preferred inflation rate is positive and has been trending upward over time. The basic data on inflation, unemployment and the outcome of presidential elections from 1920-88 are presented in Table 1. For the entire period one can encompass all those non turnover cases where the incumbent political party did not loose the election by fitting a simple parabola to the data points for 1928, 1936 and 1988.

Voters evaluate candidates by their positions on the issue space and by a valence or general ability dimension. Some individual's (the informed) have more precise information about the relative abilities of candidates than others (the uninformed). Since public opinion polls reflect the information of the informed, high approval for a candidate at the polls signals to the uninformed that he is more likely to be abler. However, high approval may also reflect changes in the distribution of the public on the issue space. As a result the uninformed partly confuse the two effects and public opinion polls tend to reinforce the effects of shifts in the public's ideological preferences on election results. A shift to the right that shows up as more support for the right-wing candidate at the polls is partly interpreted as a higher efficiency of this candidate. As a result he wins with a higher margin than the margin he would have won with in the absence of polls or under perfect information. Collapse"

Hence the central purpose of this paper is to propose an alternative interpretation of these continous models as limiting approximations of discrete population models.

108149,1991,regional science and urban economics,market structure and the production-location decision,market structure and the production location decision,"s of Accepted Papers Reducing Moral Hazard at the Expense of Market Discipline: The Effectiveness of Double Liability before and during the Great Depression Haelim Anderson, Office of Financial Research, U.S. Treasury Daniel Barth, Office of Financial Research, U.S. Treasury Dong Beom Choi, Federal Reserve Bank of New York In this paper, we study the effectiveness of double liability as a regulatory tool for reducing bank risk and a safety net for protecting depositors. We begin by providing a simple model that characterizes two competing effects of double liability on bank risk-taking. We first develop a model that demonstrates two competing effects of double liability: a direct effect that constrains bank risk-taking due to increased skin in the game (Esty (1998), Grossman (2001), Mitchener and Richardson (2013), Koudijs and Salisbury (2016)), and an indirect effect that promotes risk-taking due to weaker monitoring by better protected depositors (Calomiris and Kahn (1991), Diamond and Rajan (2001)). The model predicts that while double liability unambiguously makes deposits stickier when negative information is revealed (i.e., less ex post deposit outflow), its overall effect on ex ante risk-taking is unclear. To our knowledge, this tradeoff between the direct effect reduced and the indirect effect of weaker market discipline has not been explored in the literature. This theoretical ambiguity suggests that the effectiveness of double liability is ultimately an empirical question. We test the model’s predictions using a novel identification strategy that compares state fed-member banks and national banks in New York and New Jersey. In order to identification difficulties due to differences in local economic conditions, regulation, supervision, and other unobservable characteristics, we use a novel identification strategy based on the unique regulatory environment prior to the Great Depression. By limiting our focus to national and state fed-member banks — which faced the same regulatory requirements as national banks — we control for regulation. However, national and state fedmember banks are not directly comparable because the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) supervised the former, while the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (NY Fed) supervised the latter. Further, observed differences between the banks in New York and New Jersey could result from supervision and other unobservables due to differing charter types rather than liability structure. We follow a differences-in-differences style specification in which we compare differences between national and state fed-member banks in New York (with the same liability structure) to differences between national and state fed-members banks in New Jersey (with different liability structure); Our identification assumption is that differences in bank risk taking or deposit outflows that result from differences in bank charter types are the same in these two neighboring states. Lastly, we compare national and state fed-member banks within the same county to more tightly control for local economic conditions. We find no evidence that double liability reduced bank risk-taking prior to the Great Depression, but do find evidence that deposits in double liability banks were stickier and less susceptible to runs during the Great Depression. Our findings suggest that the banking system was inherently fragile under double liability because of the tradeoff between shareholder incentive alignment and depositor market discipline; the depositor protection feature of double liability reduced the threat of funding outflows and may have undermined its effectiveness as a regulatory tool for reducing bank risk. The Role of Universities in Local Invention: Evidence from the Establishment of U.S. Colleges Michael Andrews, Northwestern University I exploit historical natural experiments to study how establishing a new college affects local invention. Throughout the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, many new colleges were established in the U.S. I use data on the site selection decisions for a subset of these colleges to identify ``runner-up'' locations that were strongly considered to become the site of a new college but were ultimately not chosen for reasons that are as good as random assignment. The runner-up counties are similar to the winning college counties along observable dimensions. Using the runner-up counties as counterfactuals, I find that the establishment of a new college caused 43% more patents per year in college counties relative to the runners-up. I next merge the patent data to rich individual-level datasets to determine the relative importance of several channels through which colleges can cause these additional patents. The first individual-level dataset is a novel collection of historical college yearbooks that contain the names of college alumni and faculty. Matching these names to the patent record, I document that alumni of a particular college account for only about 3% of the additional patents in that college’s county. College faculty account for roughly 1% of the additional patents. The second dataset is the 100% U.S. federal decennial population censuses, which I use to determine whether patentees were living in college or runner-up counties at the time the college is established or if they migrated after the fact. Patents by individuals who were present in college counties at the time the school was established, and thus are affected only knowledge spillover channels, account for about 1.4% of the additional patents. By the far the largest channel through which colleges affect patenting is by driving migration: depending on how migration is accounted for, it explains 15-85% of the increase in patenting in college counties relative to the runner-up counties. Finally, I test whether colleges are better at promoting invention than other policies that lead to similar increases in population. To do this, I compare counties that receive a college to counties that receive another state institutions, such as a prison, hospital, or asylum, at the same time. Both population and patenting grow very similarly in the college counties and the counties with other institutions. I thus conclude that, while establishing a new college does increase patenting, most of this is driven by population rather than the direct effects of the college, and moreover other types of institutions are just as effective at increasing population and patenting. Reconstruction Aid, Public Infrastructure, and Economic Growth Nicola Bianchi, Northwestern University Michela Giorcelli, University of California, Los Angeles This paper studies the effects of international reconstruction aid on long-term economic growth. Specifically, it uses evidence from the Marshall Plan in Italy to estimate the effect of the reconstruction and modernization of public infrastructure on a wide array of economic outcomes. We first collected and digitized new data on the quantity of Marshall Plan aid received by each Italian province between 1948 and 1952. We then combined this dataset with province-level industrial and economic outcomes digitized from the Industrial Census, the Population Census, the Annals of Agricultural Statistics, and official lists of patents issued by the Italian Patent Office. Finally, we matched these sources with granular data on Allied bombings compiled by the US Air Force. We estimate the causal effects of the Marshall Plan aid by exploiting the geographical distribution of Allied bombings in Italy during the last stages of World War II (March 1944-April 1945). Specifically, we instrument the amount of reconstruction grants received by each Italian province with the amount of bombings dropped by Allied forces against the invading Nazi troops. This variable has two features that make it suitable to be a good instrumental variable. First, the Allies dropped these explosives when Italy had already quit the war by signing the Armistice of Cassibile (September 3, 1943). The geographical distribution of these air attacks, therefore, mostly followed the land battles between Allied and German troops on the Italian soil, which were plausibly not correlated with other factors (such as prewar economic conditions) that might have affected postwar growth. Second, some of the preferred targets were railways and roads, because many of these bombings intended to stop reinforcements and supplies from Germany. By targeting public infrastructure, these air attacks drew a large amount of reconstruction grants from the Marshall Plan. We find three main results. First, in provinces that received more grants, industrial and agricultural outputs increased more after the disbursement of reconstruction grants. Second, growth in industry and agriculture had different characteristics. The Italian industry experienced the entry of many new firms and an expansion of its labor force. The agricultural sector, instead, increased production, but sustained a stark decrease in labor force. Third, the adoption of newer technologies increased disproportionately in provinces with more grants and higher growth. In agriculture, for example, we observe a larger increase in the use of general-purpose tractors in provinces that received more international aid. Similarly, firms and individuals in provinces that received more grants started developing more patents. Did provinces with more bombings during the Italian Campaign merely recover faster from WWII? Or did they experience a larger economic expansion? We find that most outcomes surpassed their pre-war levels between 1952 and 1971 (the second Census available after the conclusion of the Marshall Plan in 1952).

The output vector includes the number of stations served and the service territory area. Economies of scale are exhausted beyond 992 stations with growth through territorial expansion. The threshold for expansion through densification is 51,053 stations. These results suggest that the optimal LEC's size is small, and that competition may be the most efficient form of production organization for medium to large markets in rural and low-density urban settings.

The developer is assumed to require at least a certain size of contiguous land to obtain a profit, which he tries to procure by sequential negotiation procedures. The results suggest a ‘maximum principle of negotiation’, namely that an optimal order of negotiation should always satisfy the condition that regardless of whether or not any given negotiation fails, the remaining order continues to be optimal for the rest of negotiations. It may be optimal for the developer to procure land unit which is never used in the development, so that he can strengthen his bargaining position. If the size of landowners' land units are different and all units are required, the developer will choose to negotiate the owner with the largest land unit to maximize his payoff. Collapse"

Participants are found to hold significantly more of their assets in this form; over a standard savings period the incremental holdings in financial assets are equivalent to the amount saved in the contract savings scheme. The estimates support the contention that participants do not merely shift the instruments in which financial assets are held in saving for home purchase but rather make a reallocation in favor of financial assets — monies that are available for investment anywhere in the economy during the savings period.

Many states and local development authorities attempt to create jobs through the application of incentive and assistance programmes meant to attract industry, to encourage entrepreneurship, and to promote the growth of existing establishments. Despite these efforts, which in many instances are quite costly, little is known about the efficacy of particular programmes. This paper addresses the impact of such programmes by presenting the results of an econometric analysis based on micro data from an extensive mail and telephone survey of 540 new manufacturing plants in the Appalachian region. A components of growth approach is taken, in which two particular components are considered: the job growth attributable to location decisions of new start-ups; and that stemming from the expansion of existing establishments.

The costs of IDAs, especially in terms of forgone tax revenues, are documented. The benefits of IDAs are partially reviewed, and a methodology for the wider evaluation of the benefits of IDAs-which may yet become possible—is set forth. The authors conclude that New York State's experience with its IDAs provides evidence that firm-specific tax incentives are ineffective in promoting economic development. The reason is straightforward: An analysis of the evidence shows that the benefits of IDAs are questionable, whereas their costs, in terms of forgone tax revenues, are clear and substantial. Between 1987 and 1991, for example, IDA activity resulted in few verifiable economic benefits to New York State, although causing state and local governments to lose over $1.3 billion in tax revenues.

108214,1991,scandinavian journal of economics,firm size and foreign operations of multinationals,firm size and foreign operations of multinationals,"Recent studies of firm size as a determinant of executive compensation did not differentiate the impact of foreign from domestic operations despite the growing economic importance of the former. In light of the unique risk in conducting business abroad, we estimate the impact of the foreign operations of U.S.- based MNCs on the compensation of executives. The results, based on data for the period 1980-2000, indicate a significant correlation between executive compensation and the independent variables representing foreign operations, size (assets and sales) and performance (net profit). As these variables reflect the outcome of innovative strategies for profitable expansion, they are important for devising compensation packages for CEOs. This methodology is a significant improvement of the earlier models that utilize total assets, total sales, total profit etc, as explanatory variables. Some of the recent studies of executive compensation, for example, Ciscel and Carroll, (1980) and Baker, Jensen and Murphy (1988) find that the size of firms, measured by sales or revenues, is significant. Most of these studies focus on large U.S.- based firms with extensive foreign operations of over 50% of total assets, sales and net profit (see Forbes, July 26,1999). The limitation of these studies is their failure to make a distinction between domestic and foreign operations. Ongoing cross-border mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and foreign direct investments have increased the economic importance of multinational corporations' (MNCs') foreign operations. This paper examines the extent to which CEOs compensation is impacted by the size of the foreign operations of US MNCs. The unique risks (exchange rate, political, tax, economic, inflation, regulatory and multicultural, (see Shapiro, 1996) associated with foreign operations require innovative policies to maximize shareholder wealth in a competitive global economy. An empirical model, using three independent variables measuring the foreign component of total assets, sales, and net income, is estimated using annual data for the period 1980-2000. Companies with significant foreign operations are examined. We offer the following hypotheses H1: The higher the foreign/total sales ratio the higher will be the level of compensation. H2: The higher the foreign/total asset ratio the higher will be the level of compensation. H3: The higher the foreign/total profit ratio the higher will be the level of compensation. The main reason for promoting these hypotheses is that foreign operations require greater managerial effort and /or a higher skill level, which should be highly compensated. The importance of this paper must be viewed in light of: (a) the challenging tasks faced by CEOs because of increasing transnational activities, and (b) the development of appropriate compensation packages in recognition of the foreign risks. Lambert and Larcker (1991) note that an increase in the risk exposure may cause a CEO to be conservative in his investment strategy and turn down risky projects that may promise higher expected returns to shareholders or accept ""safe"" projects with stable but substandard returns. McLaughlin (1991, page 22) also notes that ""the tax, legal, regulatory, and economic environment in which a compensation program must function is constantly changing and this can undermine or thwart well-intentioned plans."" PREVIOUS RESEARCH CEO compensation contracts have received considerable critical scrutiny, primarily that compensations are unrelated to firm profitability. The effect of firm size on compensation is the primary focus of the earlier studies, for example, Baumol (1959) contends that executive salaries are more correlated with the scale of a firm's operation than with its profitability, McGuire, Chiu, and Elbing (1962), find executive compensation (measured by salary plus bonus) more correlated with sales than profitability, thus lending further support to the ""revenue-maximizing"" theory of the firm. … Collapse"

Conversely, working-class women tended to give their families the highest priority in their lives, and family concerns were more likely to intrude upon work than work upon family, largely due to structural disadvantages such as inadequate child care and inflexible work schedules.

We attempt to measure the extent to which changes in legal policy have generated improvement in establishing paternity and obtaining child support orders for this group of families. We construct crude time series of the ratios of paternity adjudications to out-of-wedlock births and then we use Census data to test whether any improvements in obtaining child support result from changes in the demographic characteristics of never-married women. We find that improvement is chiefly due to legal changes. Despite improvement, however, adjudication rates and rates of obtaining child support orders are very low. In 1986, 66 percent of all potentially eligible children born to never-married mothers between 1980 and 1986 were without the legal basis for a child support award. Collapse"

108239,1991,social science quarterly,entrepreneurship and innovation in small manufacturing firms,entrepreneurship and innovation in small manufacturing firms,"INTRODUCTION Entrepreneurship has long been associated with small businesses and new ventures (Carland, Hoy, Boulton & Carland, 1984). The idea of an individual identifying an untapped market niche or inventing a new product goes hand in hand with the traditional perspective. In fact, Stevenson, Roberts and Grousbeck (1989) define entrepreneurship as a process of creating value by employing a unique set of resources to exploit an opportunity. However, in recent years, entrepreneurship researchers have increasingly recognized that entrepreneurial activity can and does take place in large businesses (de Chambeau & Mackenzie, 1986; Adams, Wortman & Spann, 1988; Ellis & Taylor, 1988; Morris, Avila & Allen, 1993). Brandt (1986) presents the position that the entrepreneurial process has applicability to organizations of all sizes. In the large firm setting, the term generally used is intrapreneurship and an intrapreneur is defined by Pinchot (1985) as ""Those who take the hands-on responsibility for creating innovation of any kind within an organization"" (p. ix). In the small business setting, entrepreneurship is almost universally taken as a positive, beneficial phenomenon (Carland & Carland, 1993). It is intricately linked with innovation (Carland, et. al., 1984). Due to its rich background in the small business arena, the authors were interested in exploring the impact of entrepreneurship within the corporate setting. Given that intrapreneurship exists within large, established firms, how does it manifest itself? What is intrapreneurship and what effect does it have on a firm's performance? This paper represents an effort to investigate intrapreneurship and its linkage to financial performance. INTRAPRENEURSHIP The various definitions of intrapreneurship appearing in the literature are remarkably similar. De Chambeau & Mackenzie (1986) say that ""Intrapreneurial activity ranges from the development of a new product to the creation of a more cost-efficient process (p. 45)."" Jennings and Young (1990) define corporate entrepreneurship as the process of developing new products and/or markets. Hornsby, Montagno and Kuratko (1990) describe intrapreneurship as a means to increase corporate success through the creation of new corporate ventures. McGrath, Venkataraman, MacMillan and Boulind (1992) describe corporate entrepreneurship as a means for firms to change their pool of competencies to increase long term economic viability. Hornsby, Naffziger, Kuratko and Montagno (1993) refer to the development of new business endeavors within the corporate framework. Note that the intrapreneurial perspective is similar to the entrepreneurial in terms of its focus on innovation. In fact, the corporate entrepreneurial construct has three accepted dimensions in the literature (Morris, Avila & Allen, 1993). These include innovativeness, development of novel products, services, or processes; risk-taking; and proactiveness (Covin & Slevin, 1989; Ginsberg, 1985; Jennings & Young, 1990; Khandwalla, 1977; Miles & Arnold, 1991; Miller & Friesen, 1983). All of the definitions of intrapreneurship have been highly consistent (Cornwall & Hartman, 1988). Zahra (1986) examined the antecedents of corporate entrepreneurship and found that most people see it as being innovative activities within a firm. EMPHASIS ON INNOVATION Most researchers clearly see creativity and/or innovation as the focus of intrapreneurial activities. Intrapreneurs are innovators and idea generators. The outcomes of these innovations range from new products to new markets to new processes. However, Knight (1967) identifies new product/service innovations as the highest level results of intrapreneurial actions (Cornwall & Hartman, 1988). Jennings and Young (1990) defined intrapreneurship ""as the process of developing new products and new markets"" (p. 55). Morris, Pitt, Davis and Allen (1992) used the number of new products, services, and processes introduced by or within a firm to measure the frequency of entrepreneurship. … Collapse"

Almost all the literature on Third World urbanisation and housing appears to present the view that the development of squatter settlements has become an inevitable aspect of Third World urban development and that it constitutes the poor urbanites' response to problems of accommodation shortage, high rents and land acquisition. This paper raises several issues regarding blanket statements on, and stereotyping of, Third World cities. It argues that the so-called squatter settlements which the literature often portrays as characterising Third World cities may not be true of anglophone West African cities. The case of Kumasi, Ghana has been examined with reference to the reasons adduced by Peil to explain the absence of squatter settlements in West Africa. It points out that the reasons offered by Peil may not be tenable in the case of Kumasi, but instead suggests that people's attitude to traditions, customs and beliefs regarding land ownership and the role of the spirits of dead ancestors in the affairs of the living may in effect be safeguarding the city against the development of squatter settlements.

This article outlines two techniques which can overcome many of these measurement problems: stochastic dominance conditions, which can facilitate a robust poverty ranking of distributions of living standards; and a decomposable poverty index, which allows measured changes in aggregate poverty to be disaggregated into their various components, such as the changes among population subgroups, and growth and redistributive components. These techniques can be applied to a wide range of indicators of economic well-being and poverty lines, and to assumptions about the poor. The approaches are illustrated using household survey data from Indonesia before and after external shocks and the subsequent structural adjustment program in the mid-1980s. The study finds that favorable initial conditions and pro-poor pattern of growth enabled Indonesia to maintain its momentum in poverty alleviation during the period. Collapse"

A great many people suffered from the shortages and disruptions produced by economic warfare, whereas a few exploited the situation and grew rich. It is unfortunate that this volume lacks a systematic conclusion that might have tied the various case studies together. It is nevertheless possible to point to two important consequences of the Continental System for the following century. The first is well known and unsurprising, but still worth underscoring: the most important geopolitical result of the war against Napoleon was the consolidation of Britain’s economic and naval power. The conduct and outcome of the Continental System were, in fact, among the most important reasons why the nineteenth century became “the British century.” The second consequence, briefly mentioned in Katherine Aaslestad’s introduction but never fully developed, is less obvious but no less significant: the failure of the Continental System hastened the demise of that attitude toward economic activity conventionally called “mercantilism.” Wealth was now seen as inexorably tied to exchange rather than to possession; commerce, in turn, was recognized as the essential source of economic prosperity and, ultimately, of national power. One striking aspect of the historiography of the Continental System is how often it has been inspired and influenced by contemporary politics. This was as true for Eli Heckscher’s classic study, The Continental System: An Economic Interpretation (1922), which was written in neutral Sweden in the last months of World War I, as it was for François Crouzet’s seminal articles produced during the early movement toward European economic integration in the 1950s (“Wars, Blockade, and Economic Change in Europe,” The Journal of Economic History 24, no. 4 [1964]: 567–88), and for Stuart Woolf’s Napoleon’s Integration of Europe (1991), which reflected the revitalization of the European project in the 1980’s. One similarly detects contemporary resonances in several of the essays in Revisiting Napoleon’s Continental System, whose global perspective and often skeptical tone echo our own economic experiences.

Research conducted by the author suggests, however, that a significant portion of rural women, including many of the poorest, should not be considered as farmers at all, but as wage workers. While some women, often aided financially by men who worked away, were able to operate rural businesses and large farms, many women were confined to daily-paid temporary labor to meet their cash needs. It is suggested that rural women do not comprise a homogenous group with identical economic and political goals; nor do “female-headed” households. Female-only households, where there was no referent male working away, were notable for their poverty and lack of access to any means of agricultural production. Many women heading such households were casual workers, with all or the bulk of their income derived from wage labor. Collapse"
108312,1991,world development,grass-roots development in rural thailand:  a lost cause?,grass roots development in rural thailand   a lost cause ,"Abstract “Grass-roots” development policies have been embraced by governments, international agencies and NGOs alike as one of the most effective means of improving conditions and fostering growth in rural areas. However, in many cases there is a considerable discrepancy between word and deed, and it is rare to find grass-roots development policies being implemented in a coherent fashion. This article examines the reasons for this discrepancy with reference to rural development in Thailand. It is argued that although a centralized and inefficient bureaucracy, and entrenched interest groups, cause many of the problems of implementation, the hierarchical nature of Thai society provides much of the explanation. Further, it is argued that grass-roots ideologies, based upon conceptualizations of folk/peasant culture, may be no more in-tune with the aspirations of peasants than those orthodox strategies they aim to replace. As such, grass-roots development policies may be seen as being incompatible with the planning context, and thus face long-term and deep-seated constraints to effective implementation. Collapse"
108315,1991,world development,"debt, deficits and dollars: the world economy in 3-d",debt  deficits and dollars  the world economy in 3 d,"Abstract The world economy in the 1980s was dominated by problems of international debt, balance-of-payments and fiscal deficits, and exchange rate instability. Analyzing these three problems, this paper attempts to demonstrate how changes in both the international financial regime and the conduct of macroeconomic policy at the global level are required if they are to be avoided in the 1990s. Recognizing the bureaucratic and political constraints on far-reaching reform, the paper spells out a number of less ambitious options which could, nonetheless, have a beneficial effect on the world economy. An implication of all the reforms discussed, touching on both financing and adjustment, is an increase in the relative importance of the official sector, in the form of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, as compared with the private sector, in the form of the international commercial banks. In this regard, as well as in terms of some of their specifics, the proposals find a strong antecedent in the Keynes Plan that was presented to the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944. As then, the argument here is that international financial reform based on a coherent perspective of the world economy can make an important contribution toward bringing about balanced and sustainable world economic expansion.

Some have argued that Congress may strip the Court of all its appellate jurisdiction, withhold jurisdiction from the lower federal courts, and thereby all but eliminate the judicial branch. Others have argued that the Supreme Court has an ""essential role"" that Congress may not destroy through exceptions. Still others have argued that the exceptions clause gives Congress unfettered discretion to distribute appellate jurisdiction among the federal courts — that is, to make exceptions in favor of other Article III courts.This Note presents a new argument in support of the ""essential role"" thesis and against the view that all federal courts are equal and interchangeable. It will argue that the original jurisdiction clause reflects the Framers’ vision of the Supreme Court as the most important court in the nation. The Framers assigned these cases to the most important court out of respect for the dignity of the parties involved and because the Framers thought these cases would be unusually sensitive — so sensitive that they might take the United States to war. If the Framers meant for the Supreme Court to be the most important court, they must also have meant the exceptions power to be limited rather than absolute. The exceptions power cannot include the power to strip the Supreme Court of all appellate jurisdiction because Congress could then destroy the Supreme Court’s status as the nation’s most important court.

The Ethical Basis for Preservation of Diversity In 1949, Aldo Leopold advocated the extension of ethical obligations to the relations between man and nature, calling for the development of an ""ecological conscience"" reflecting ""a conviction of individual responsibility for the health of the land."" 51 Since then, several commentators have argued that nonhuman organisms, and even nonliving natural objects, have or should have rights based on their intrinsic value. 5 2 Under such a view, human beings have an ethical obligation not to destroy these creatures and objects, at least in the absence of a strong countervailing value. 53 An ethical obligation to ""nature"" could conceivably be directed primarily to individuals, species, ecosystems, or the global environment as a whole. Human beings find it easiest to empathize and identify with individual beings and with vertebrate animals, which appear more similar to humans than invertebrates or plants. Therefore, people may most readily accept a moral obligation toward individual ""higher"" animals. 54 Animal liberation philosophers have proposed ethical obligations toward all creatures able to experience pain, or capable of valuing their lives. 55 50. The art analogy may prove too much. Virtually everyone, including museum curators, would agree that the obligation to preserve artworks extends only to exceptional or unique examples. No one argues that all works of art must be preserved. Species and ecosystems may perhaps be viewed as possessing esthetic appeal beyond that of art objects, due to the fact that they are not created through human mechanisms and are (at least at the moment) beyond full human understanding. However, it is difficult to guess what proportion of Americans would adopt this view of the relative esthetic value of species and artworks. 51. The Land Ethic, supra note 48, at 258. 52. Eg., D.

It is wrong when it tends otherwise."" 59 Those espousing this view have emphasized the importance of the continuation of the biotic community, and the moral considerability of ecosystems and species. 60 Some commentators have argued that species have a right to function normally in their ecosystems; 6' this right may be viewed as a right to self-actualization. This holistic view, taken to its logical extreme, regards life itself as the fundamental good to be preserved. 62 One possible theoretical basis for regarding life as the ultimate good has been advanced by Birch and Cobb, who point out that only life creates order out of chaos, and conclude that life is therefore the fundamental value.63 Rolston offers another reason for valuing life and its manifestations: nature has an ""exuberant lust for kinds"" that humans ought not to inhibit.64 The beings, or at least all nonconscious beings. 56.

Several philosophers and theologians, while not granting ""rights"" similar to those held by human beings to other species or to natural systems, have appealed to a tradition of human responsibility for stewardship of the Earth.66 The theological argument for stewardship proceeds from the premise that God created nature in part for his own enjoyment. The nature of the creation gives rise to a three-fold role for man with respect to nature: man is both overlord, wondering onlooker, and caretaker. 67 The combination of these roles requires that man, insofar as possible, allow nature to flourish and to continue in its place. This duty to nature is not absolute, however; it occupies a position secondary to man's duty to his fellow man.68 Man can and should also enhance nature under this view, by taking actions such as designing gardens, or creating new creatures through breeding. 69 4.

108375,1991,american economic review,standards versus standards: the effects of different pollution restrictions,standards versus standards the effects of different pollution restrictions,"When economists refer to pollution standards, they almost universally mean uniform restrictions on pollution emissions (e.g., William J. Baumol and Wallace E. Oates, 1975 Ch. 13; Susan Rose-Ackerman, 1973; David Besanko, 1978). However, in practice, standards take many forms: not only emissions restrictions, but restrictions on pollution per unit of output or per unit of an input, restrictions on the use of a polluting input, or mandated use of a particular pollution-control technology. These specifications of regulations will have a variety of effects on a firm's resource-allocation decisions. For instance, allowing pollution per unit of output as the standard instead of directly restricting the level of pollution gives the firm some choice: in addition to reducing pollution, it can increase its output to ""dilute"" the pollution. This paper examines the effects of five different forms of pollution standards on input decisions, the level of production, and firm profits. The results show that the different standards, by providing firms with different incentives, change the firm's allocation decisions and affect the relative profitability of the standards. Section I reviews the existing literature on the incentives of different instruments. The following section describes the model to be used. Five different forms of pollution constraints are individually examined in Section III using a graphical approach. Their relative effects, as well as some special cases, are assessed in Section IV. Finally, Section V raises the case of different standards when firms are not identical. Collapse"

Amiran and Daniel A. Hagen (2003) that there can be a substantial, or even infinite, divergence between the WTA and WTP for a public good even where there is a nonzero elasticity of substitution between market goods and the public good, provided that the indifference curves are asymptotically bounded with respect to market goods in the manner they describe. This is an important point. They are also correct to point out that the elasticity of substitution is a local concept, whereas their asymptotic boundedness condition applies also for discrete changes. My 1991 paper used a local analysis because it was following the structure of the analysis in Robert D. Willig (1976) and Alan Randall and John R. Stoll (1980); I wanted to show that, while Randall and Stoll appeared to extend Willig’s local result on WTA versus WTP from price changes to changes in the quantity of a public good, the relevant elasticity was in fact different and involved the substitution elasticity as well as the income elasticity. I view these points by Amiran and Hagen as not two separate results but essentially the same result: their asymptotic boundedness condition generalizes my zero elasticity of substitution condition to discrete changes. The asymptotic boundedness condition can be expressed as follows: assuming a bivariate utility function u( x, q), and given a reference point ( x*, q*) associated with a reference utility level u* u( x*, q*), there exists some q q* such that, for all q q , there exists no x such that u( x , q) u*. In other words, no amount of x can substitute for the reduction in public good from q* to q q . In the case of a zero elasticity of substitution, q q* but, as Amiran and Hagen show in their Theorem 1, this is unnecessarily restrictive when dealing with a discrete reduction in q. Furthermore, their Theorem 2 can be viewed as a special case of their Theorem 1 in which q 0, which makes q an essential commodity. It is well known in consumer theory that the WTA to avoid the loss of an essential market good is infinite; their Theorem 2 extends this result to the case of an essential nonmarket good. But, as their Theorem 1 shows, essentialness is not necessary for an infinite WTA. The boundedness condition is the key, and this implies a fundamental lack of substitutability between money (market goods) and the public good. Collapse"

108378,1991,american economic review,increasing the profits of a subset of firms in oligopoly models with strategic substitutes,increasing the profits of a subset of firms in oligopoly models with strategic substitutes,"Consider an industry composed of N firms in a symmetric equilibrium. Designate a subset of S (< N) firms and marginally reduce the strategic variables of the firms in the subset. If the remaining firms simultaneously make the best reply to this exogenous displacement, under what circumstances will profits of the firms in the designated subset increase? We show that, in the case of Cournot competition among producers of perfect substitutes, a marginal contraction is strictly beneficial (strictly harmful) if and only if the number of firms in the designated subset exceeds the ""adjusted"" number of firms outside it by strictly more (strictly less) than one. The adjustment factor is unity when cost and demand functions are linear but, more generally, depends on the convexity of the cost and demand curves. Thus, a marginal contraction of two firms in a triopoly has no effect on the profits of firms in the subset if cost and demand functions are linear; if instead cost is linear but the inverse demand function is strictly concave (strictly convex), a marginal contraction will strictly decrease (strictly increase) profits. The analysis is extended to the effects of nonmarginal exogenous changes in the outputs of the constrained firms. This extension has implications for the relationship of Stackelberg (sequential move) and Nash (simultaneous move) equilibria. Our analysis has broad application. To illustrate, we show that it unifies results in the literature on export subsidies, horizontal mergers, and strikes. The paper is organized as follows. In Section I, our comparative-static result is derived. In Section II, we present a wide range of applications. In the conclusion and the Appendix we generalize our analysis to other situations involving strategic substitutes. Collapse"

In both models, the analysis starts by assuming a large set of consumers who adjust in a perfectly competitive way. Only the firms are supposed to behave strategically and to privilege one strategic variable, the quantity produced or the selling price. This paper is an attempt – among others1 – to integrate the two models and to admit the interaction of the to kinds of strategic variables. This integration will be based on a reinterpretation of Augustin Cournot’s approach. In the famous chapter in which Cournot (1838) introduced his oligopoly theory, he does mention, from the start that the selling price should “necessarily” be the same for each producer. However, he does not elaborate much on price formation, except to say that it is convenient to use the inverse demand function.

108380,1991,american economic review,redistribution and capital formation,redistribution and capital formation,"Volume 2 (1990/1991): Industrialization Based on Agricultural Development According to predictions by international economic and financial institutions, sub-Saharan Africa is the only geo-region where the current economic growth, even at optimistic assumptions, will not be sufficient to improve human living conditions up to the end of the century. The World Bank, for instance, expects the number of poor people in Africa to increase from the present figure of 180 million to 265 million people by the year 2000. Against this background the African Development Perspectives Yearbook aims at presenting and promoting theoretical and practical approaches, which redefine a crucial element of economic success and thus can prevent a repetition of ""lost decades"" for development. The point in question is the very core of modern economic growth – industrialization. The African Development Perspectives Yearbook advocates an industrialization strategy for Africa based on agricultural development and taking full account of the human dimensions of economic progress. The global economic environment of the 1980s, which can be characterised by the debt crisis and the drop in most raw material prices, was generally unfavourable for developing countries. In Africa, particularly, many endeavours to promote industrialization were therefore interrupted. Furthermore, the economically more developed countries presently have only a marginal interest in sub-Saharan Africa – although particularly now economic co-operation and free access to markets would be necessary in order to improve Africa’s plight. Even though African countries de jure have preferential access to the EC markets, as guaranteed by the Lomé-IV Convention, nevertheless non-tariff barriers and the stabilisation of lopsided African production structures by STABEX and SYSMIN programmes have made it difficult for Africa to improve its foreign trade relations. The establishment of the Single European Market and the expected outcome of the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations threaten to be further steps in the same direction. Only agricultural products and mineral raw materials will remain capable of being exported, while the export of processed or even semi-processed commodities, which are less prone to price recessions, will still be obstructed. In the past, the compulsion to earn hard foreign currency in order to repay foreign loans often led to increased exports of raw materials and agricultural products, while on the other hand African governments denied further support to food crop production and local industries. The example of Nigeria, however, to which a separate unit of the African Development Perspectives Yearbook’s second volume is dedicated, shows that foreign trade influences are not alone responsible for the setbacks in industrialization. The inability to channel capital inflows into viable economic activities can be considered a lost opportunity for development. The oil-fuelled growth of the country’s economy seeped away in the swamps of an unbalanced import-substitution policy with its exclusive concentration on the production of consumer goods, too strong tendencies of regional agglomeration, an industrialization based on large-scale and capital-intensive plants dependent on foreign sourcing, and weak inter-sectoral linkages. A new strategy of industrialization... In contrast to the case of Nigeria, countries like Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mauritius can be mentioned, which managed to succeed, even if only to a limited extent, in an unfavourable global economic environment. Interestingly enough, these countries show that the public sector plays a stronger role in a successful industrialization strategy than has been asserted in some contributions to recent discussions on development issues. With these facts in mind, the authors of the African Development Perspectives Yearbook emphasise that ""wholesale"" theories offered before and shortly after the change of paradigms in development theory, have become obsolete. The state cannot be considered to be the driving force in a catching-up industrialization, but equally its complete retreat from structural tasks cannot contribute to a satisfactory solution of development problems. The essential requirement, however, is for highly specified policies, which can also overcome the already observable adjustment-weariness of Third World economies. An open trade regime, promoting exports, and the provision of institutional links between large-scale and smallscale industries seem to be equally as important as selective involvement of the state in economic activities and selective external protection policies. Moreover, an industrial rehabilitation programme has to be added which can achieve an efficiency increase, starting from the company level. The highest priority should be given to indigenous or locally developed forms of technology. Recent experience has shown that this kind of specific intervention should even be preferred to an indirect promotion of the economy, for instance by creating a ""supportive entrepreneurial environment"". However, contrary to what the programmes of the first Industrial Development Decade for Africa (IDDA 1) suggested, the main emphasis should be put on promoting small and medium-sized enterprises. They should be given preferential treatment, for instance by means of trade policies when establishing new industrial projects. There are several reasons for this approach. Firstly, in the past importdependent large-scale projects were found to be highly vulnerable. This vulnerability can be reduced by local sourcing, by serving local demand, and by exporting to regional markets. Smaller production units are better suited to these tasks than larger ones. Secondly, small-scale production units in the traditional sub-sector, and possibly only these, as suggested by a case study from Sudan, promise linkages between the industrial and the agricultural sector, particularly in rural areas. This leads to the core of the alternative industrialization strategy advocated by the authors of the African Development Perspectives Yearbook: industrialization policy has to be complemented by an active agricultural policy. While this opinion is held by all the contributors to the Yearbook, there are, of course, differences of emphasis. The common denominator consists in the realisation that lack of agricultural development impedes overall economic growth because of the shortage of domestic market demand. The authors of the Yearbook consider it insufficient only to increase producer prices, which is the conventionally proposed solution. This approach does not take full account of the structure of income and expenditure at the household level. One instead has to distinguish between net purchasers and net sellers of food in farm households. The minimal programme of a long-term-oriented, and thus agriculture-based industrialization, also includes a redistribution of entitlements to the means of production, i.e. land reform, supporting demand by the creation of non-agricultural employment opportunities in rural areas, and a rise in labour productivity by investment in education and health. The most radical approach aims at a reversal of the present sectoral priority. The agricultural-demand led industrialization strategy (ADLI) regards strong support for the agricultural sector as the precondition for balanced economic growth. Both the location of production units in rural areas and small towns and labourintensive processing of agricultural products make a further contribution to strong growth impulses from investment in agriculture. A problem arises, of course, from the fact that an ADLI-strategy brings only a limited expansion of industrial supply. In order to exclude the danger of inflation, this strategy should therefore be supplemented by import-substitution policies, which should not, however, be restricted to consumer goods and urban demand. Authors of the Yearbook, who advocate this radical approach, are well aware of the limits set by ecological constraints with regard to an agricultural ""big push"". The reason is that only parts of Africa’s ecozones are suited to intensive agriculture. At most one half of the productive land is suitable for irrigation, whilst ecozones like the Sahel have to be left to extensive use only. ... embedded into a strategy of sustainable development The alternative industrialization strategy presented so far can only endure when embedded into a comprehensive development concept. Its main elements will consist of  people’s participation in planning their own future;  poverty alleviation, equality of opportunities, and equitable growth;  full consideration of environmental demands; and  solidarity of the international community with Africa (and other poverty zones of the world). The establishment of political institutions which guarantee permanent and comprehensive involvement of such social organisations as trade unions, churches, and NGOs/voluntary development organisations in decisionmaking processes is an essential prerequisite for successful and sustainable development. Political consensus, as shown in the Yearbook by the example of Mauritius, is a precondition for economic success rather than its result. The second volume of the Yearbook also documents Africa’s political changes since 1990 and shows that NGOs acquired an increasingly important role in the democratisation process. NGOs can, for instance, even assume classical functions of the state or represent the interests of social formations, e.g. the labourers, whose traditional organisations are endangered by collapsing industrial structures. By reprinting the Popular Charter for Participation, the African Development Perspectives Yearbook documents an important step towards the realisation of these ideas.

Focusing on data from Israel, it is demonstrated that: the costs of distance are persistent even in telecommunications systems; for short distances or small regions, transport costs are not necessarily higher than telecommunications costs; and pricing of telecommunications services by governments often does not reflect the costs of providing the services. A cost distribution is created that differs from Euclidean geographical distances: discontinuities in the rate structure of telecommunications distort the distance-cost schedules and by creating barriers, may affect location decisions. It is shown that actual interaction costs are context specific; therefore, no general model has been formulated.

The policy implications of the model are very different from those traditionally put forward to moderate wage pressure. Copyright 1991 by The London School of Economics and Political Science.

The well-know Mishkin econometric procedure is applied to the annual IMF date for the decomposition of actual money growth into anticipated and unanticipated components and the evidence of significant relation between anticipated money supply and real output for each country is reported. The results derived in this paper thus provide additional empirical support for the validity of the ‘non-classical rational expectations’ macro models of Fisher, and Phelps and Taylor. Collapse"

Developing a theoretical model of this process is not diffcult, but estimation difficulties caused by the self-selection inherent in the data subsamples of non-searchers, searchers who stay, and searchers who leave must be considered. To estimate the structural determinants of these decisions we make assumptions regarding the covariance matrix of the error terms of the structural equations that allow us to use a straightforward extension of earlier approaches to this problem. The particular variables that correspond to the theoretical measures in the model are not common to most data bases on faculty. Thus, we were forced to use a rather old data base to estimate the model, which reduces the usefulness of the estimates for current policy purposes. Nonetheless, the estimates do shed light on the efficacy of the model and illustra... Collapse"
108447,1991,applied economics,the term structure of uk interest rates:  tests of the expectations hypothesis,the term structure of uk interest rates tests of the expectations hypothesis,"Similar to the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, most central banks use the day-to-day interest rate on the inter-bank money market as their operational target. Using modern monetary instruments central banks can control very short-term interest rates. However, the problem is that the real economy (e.g. investment and consumption) and inflation, will generally be affected by the long-term interest rate. Central banks are unable to control the long-term interest rate. Therefore in order to analyse how monetary policy will affect the real economy, we need to know the relationship between short-term interest rates and long-term interest rates, referred to as the term structure of interest rates. Given the importance of knowing how this mechanism works, it is not surprising that this topic has become a highly important area of research and this is likely to continue to be the case now that the exchange rate channel does not exist in the Euro area. What is required is a theory, which will link interest rates of different maturities. The expectations hypothesis (EH) of the term structure of interest rates states that long-term interest rates depend entirely on expected future short-term interest rates. Hence the interest rate on a long-term bond (a debt instrument) will equal the average of short-term interest rates that people expect to occur over the life of the bond. This is referred to as the pure expectations hypothesis (PEH) and assumes there is no added risk to holding a longer maturity bond as opposed to a series of shorter maturity bonds, in other words the risk (term) premium is zero. It is the main theory behind the analysis of the link between interest rates of different maturities and hence is of crucial importance in understanding the impact of monetary policy on the real economy, referred to as the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Although the evidence using European data is very supportive of the EH, for interest rates at the short end of the maturity spectrum (i.e. less than 12 months), the central bank’s influence on interest rates declines as the maturities become longer. There are two possible reasons why the EH may be rejected. The first is the impact of a time varying risk premium. If agents perceive large (unpredictable) changes in short rates as a result of inflation or general uncertainty, then this will lead to rejections of the EH. The second possible reason is of a more statistical nature. The tests used may lead to false rejections of the EH because of their poor properties in finite samples. It is specifically these issues that are the main focus of this study, where we analyse the small sample properties using a number of Monte Carlo (MC) experiments. The experiments focus on the fact that the alternative single equation tests based on the regression of the change in the short-term rate on the lagged spread are prone to severe over-rejection of the EH, even when it is true. However tests of the spread on the first difference of the short-rate reject at the correct rate. We find using MC experiments that this is in fact the case and these findings are consistent with those using US data. Collapse"

The observed decline in labour productivity growth rates between the 1963–73 and 1973–82 subperiods is explained on the basis of both national and location-specific factors. An explict hypothesis examined here is that quality of life is an important area-specifc influence on productivity growth and related trends. Statistical analyses are conducted whereby either an aggregate amenity index or its individual amenity components are utilized to examine the importance of quality of life differentials. The results suggest that these amenities, particularly environmental quality, may be instrumental in explanining the differncial magnitude of the productivity slowdown across urban areas. Additional findings generally do not confirm the importance of other factors frequently cited as contributing to inter-area productivity differences. A regression diagnostic an... Collapse"

The results show that the EC multilateral aid to the LDCs is more motivated by the needs of the recipients in terms of their current account balance of payments and their state of basic human needs as these are assessed by the physical Quality of Life Index(PQLI). An important consideration, however, is also given to Community export interests and to a tendency not to allocate aid to security-sensitive countries.

Esfahani (1991) also develops a simultaneous equations model to address the simultaneity bias between GDP and export growth rates.

Little research has explored the sociodemographic representativeness of women in research studies. We examined the representativeness of female respondents across four sociodemographic factors in UK population surveys and cohort studies. Six UK population-based health surveys (from 2009–2013) and eight Medical Research Council cohort studies (from 1991 to 2014) were included. Percentages of women respondents by age, income/occupation, education status, and ethnicity were compared against contemporary population estimates. Women aged <35 years were under-represented. The oldest women were under-represented in four of nine studies. Within income/occupation, at the highest deprivation level, the range was 4 percent under-representation to 43 percent over-representation; at the lowest level, it was 6 percent under-representation to 21 percent over representation. Of nine studies reporting educational level, four under-represented women without school qualifications, and three under-represented women with degrees. One of five studies over-represented non-white groups and under-represented white women (by 9 percent). Response patterns varied by topic and recruitment and data collection methods.

Additional smoking-attributable costs included $1.5 billion for residential care, $2 billion due to workers' absenteeism, $80 million due to fires and $10.5 billion due to lost future income caused by premature death. Adjustments for future costs if smoking had not occurred and smokers had not died were estimated to be $1.5 billion. According to this analysis, smokers cost society about $15 billion while contributing roughly $7.8 billion in taxes. The results indicate that smoking-attributable costs in Canada have increased steadily since 1966 to the 1991 value of $15 billion. Nevertheless, while the determination of smoking-attributable costs is important, the issue continues to be public health.

The price a stallion owner charges depends on the quality of the stud himself, and also on the quality of his offspring. The producer's output (foals) become advertisements for the stallion when they are raced, shown, etc. They also can become substitutes for the stallion, since they are an alternative source of the stallion's genes.

The starting point is to rearrange any given specification of ‘the’ consumption function so that a nominal consumption variable is explained. This implies that different deflators for consumption, and other variables in the initial specification which are expressed in real terms, define non-nested models. We therefore examine the issue of the appropriate method of deflation used non-nested tests.

The entry equation emerges from a dynamic optimization model which allows for the costs of acquiring market share. The model is used to explore the hypothesis that the market penetration of entrants in this industry was facilitated by a post-entry advertising war which the incumbent firms lost. The basic hypothesis under examination is that advertising both facilitates and restricts entry, but that it does so in a way that varies systematically over time. The data are consistent with this view, showing that high advertising shares readily translate into high market shares, but that the escalation of industry advertising caused by entry can make high advertising entry strategies increasingly costly over time.

This is of particular interest because old age insurance in Austria is dominated by the public pension plan, so that private pension plans are of minor importance. I argue that from a theoretical point of view the actuarial unfairness of the insurance plan creates a strong incentive to withdraw from the labour force at the minimum retirement age. Secondly, the rising earnings replacement ratio might be responsible for the decreasing average retirement age. These hypotheses are tested empirically. A pooled time-series cross-sections labour force participation model is estimated for single birth year cohorts of elderly males.

It incorporates a learning mechanism whereby agents can provisionally adopt hypothetically-derived expectations as a basis for comparison with the actual outturns. Utilizing the resultant past expectational errors as indicators of the likelihood of prospective future outcomes, agents make explicit allowance a rational solution. Thus, in situations where complete information is not freely available, rationality would be approximated over time by means of a dynamic learning process which is founded on a firm empirical approach. This essential empiricism requires that the problem be examined on the basis of direct observation of applied situations.

A new definition of depletion is introduced and its estimated coefficient is found to be statistically significant. The fitted cost function parameters are then used to obtain estimates of the marginal costs of exploration for oil and gas. Our estimated marginal exploration costs are smaller than in previour studies because we have allowed for technical progress which offsets the depletion effects. These marginal cost estimates are employed, along with previous estimates of exploration rents, to measure resource scarcity. We find some evidence for the increased scarcity of oil and gas in Alberta.

Several important conclusions can be derived. First, irrespective of the variability measure employed, the results indicate the presence of a significant positive relationship between the inflation rate and its variability. This provides strong support to Okun's hypothesis. Second, this relationship is stronger during the flexible rather than the fixed exchange rate period.

More precisely, after incorporating a measure of real effective exchange rate of the British Pound into a dynamic money demand function, we estimated it for the UK using quarterly data over 1973–87 period.

Following the amendment in the Treaty of Izmir (as the legal framework for the RCD), ECO was fully launched in early 1991. In 1992, the Organization was expanded to include seven new members, namely: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The date of the Organization’s expansion to its present position, 28th November, is being observed as the ECO Day. Over the past 13 years the member states have been collaborating to accelerate the pace of regional development through their common endeavors. Besides cultural and historical interdependence, they have been able to use the existing infrastructural and business links to strengthen their major economic decisions. ECO has started several projects in priority sectors of its cooperation including energy, trade, transportation, agriculture and drug control. In this study, we evaluate the performance of ECO with emphasis on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and propose the appropriate policies for its future. Despite of this reality that ECO members have great similarities, but they are politically disaggregated. We try to consider economic and political factors simultaneously. Based on formal data in 2004, ECO members had over than 380 million people (almost 6% of world population) that mean a potential market with EU market size. However, the per capita GDP in $US was $1548 that constituted about one-fourth of world average. Also, the unemployment rate in the region was relatively high (5.8%). This trend may be worsening because the average population growth rate (1.7%) is higher than world average. On the other hand, total FDI in the ECO countries was 9 billion dollars in 2004(only 1.4% of total FDI in the world). So, to appraisal the FDI trends in the ECO countries, we need to consider the main factors affecting FDI. Some of these factors are per capita GDP, exchange rate, openness ratio, inflation rate, external debt and ICRG risk factor. We will apply the econometric methods (Generalized Least Squares +fixed or random effects) with panel data over the 1992-2005 period. In this regard, the related tests including unit root test, Hausman test, Normality test… will be provided. It is expected that increases in per capita GDP, openness ratio and exchange rate(as devaluation form) will raise FDI, but inflation rate, accumulated external debt ,economic and political risks will decrease the FDI in the region. Based on our conclusions, ECO members can benefit from their different relative advantages including large market for own and foreigners, tourism, historical and cultural linkages, idle capacities(including young and unemployed people) and various natural resources(mineral and non-mineral resources); and reach to sustainable development if they manage their possibilities and potentials; and provide the context to attract FDI without considering some dilemmatic political or religious resistances and pressures.

108683,1991,econometrica,social stability and equilibrium,social stability and equilibrium,"With a population near 800 million and an annual growth rate of 2.2%, India continues to face problems in meeting its goals of food security and stability. In the past, irrigation investments and a buffer stock program have been important government of India (GOI) policy instruments for stabilizing foodgrain supplies. This paper develops a food grain sector model that links an optimization model and a simulation model through a stochastic rainfall model. The foodgrain model is used to estimate alternative paths of future irrigation investment across six regions for different buffers stock levels. Optimal operating rules are developed for both irrigation investment and the buffer stock program. The foodgrain model suggests that India's goal of self-sufficiency needs to be redefined. The complementarities among irrigation investment (new irrigation and rehabilitation), the buffer stock program, and the level of foodgrain imports show that these policy instruments need to be considered together. Each cannot be optimized in isolation. For example, as the relative cost of irrigation continues to climb, foodgrain imports and the buffer stock program may well have to play a larger role in stabilizing foodgrain supplies. If the irrigation budget is reduced by 50% because of higher costs, expected annual foodgrain imports of 8 million tons will be needed to meet future foodgrain targets. The regional distribution of investments may also need to be more targeted. Certain regions such as southern India and Uttar Pradesh may require special emphasis because of their iii unique contribution to stability in foodgrain production and their potential for increased irrigation. The simulation and optimization models together with the stochastic rainfall model provide a powerful tool for analyzing irrigation investment strategies over time and among regions as well as the trade-offs with the buffer stock program and foodgrain imports for meeting GOI's foodgrain objectives. In the final analyses, the effectiveness of GOI's irrigation investment and buffer stock program will depend on a well specified foodgrain import policy. In fact, a more liberal foodgrain import policy is probably in India's own best interests as it tries to increase and bring stability to future foodgrain supplies. 1 February 1991 MODELING POLICY OPTIONS FOR IRRIGATION INVESTMENT, BUFFER STOCK LEVELS AND FOODGRAIN IMPORTS IN INDIA Jorge Ramirez and K. William Easter Introduction India has a population of nearly 800 million, growing at an annual rate of about 2.2%. Although since 1960 average real income has increased, about 25% of the population continues to live in conditions of absolute poverty. Most of the poor are in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their living. Agriculture continues to be the dominant sector of the Indian economy, contributing about 40% of the national income and engaging almost 70% of the total labor force of the country. Agricultural growth will be critical to achieving India's goal of eliminating poverty, creating full employment, and generating self-sustaining economic growth by the year 2000. Success will depend not only on growth in agricultural production, but also on the particular paths chosen to meet growth targets. In this difficult environment Indian policy-makers, deciding on how irrigation development should proceed, have inherited an additional challenge. They must face the reality that irrigation has grown relatively more expensive and will get even more expensive 'Director of Agricultural Planning, Departamento National de Planeacion, Jefe de la Unidad de Desarrollo Agrario, Calle 26, No. 13-19, Bogota Columbia, and Professor in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota, 1994 Buford Ave., St. Paul, Minnesota, 55108 U.S.A., respectively. This paper is based on the first author's Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Minnesota. 2 in the future, since the lower cost sites were developed first. The unit cost of establishing and maintaining irrigation capacity is rising at an accelerating rate. Thus, returns to irrigation investment will diminish if output prices increase at a lower rate than costs. In addition, by the year 2010, the Seventh Plan's projections indicate that India will have reached her ultimate irrigation potential, estimated at 113.5 million ha. Irrigation is one important means of stabilizing annual crop production by mitigating the impact of irregular and inadequate rainfall. Another stabilization option is to carry a buffer stock. Because of the high variability of foodgrain production, the Government of India (GOI) has long used the irrigation option and, in 1969, decided to also build a buffer stock of foodgrains. By 1985, India had 24 million tons of foodgrains in its buffer stock. This paper presents a model for determining optimal paths of future irrigation investment across different regions for different buffer stock levels in order to meet the goals set by the Planning Commission (self-sufficiency and output stability). A stochastic approach is used to analyze the Indian foodgrain sector and to link the optimization and simulation models which serve as a means for establishing optimal operating rules for irrigation investment and the buffer stock program. The stochasticity of rainfall is introduced into the Indian foodgrain model, through a multivariate autoregressive model which generates monthly rainfall at the state (geographic) level (figure 1). This model provides us with the flexibility to explore the behavior of the system under statistically real historical rainfall patterns. 3 Agricultural Sector Model The sector is made up of three distinct submodels as shown in figure 1. The first is an optimization model which consists of a dynamic programming model where the objective function involves optimizing the expected value of government expenditures on the irrigation and buffer stock programs. Optimal irrigation investment is found from the programming model which is directly fed into the simulation model, where it is tested under a stochastic environment (rainfall). To perform this test, a buffer stocking policy and/or a foodgrain import policy have to be defined ex-ante. This test is performed with a number of simulations, each for a particular rainfall sequence generated using the multivariate AR(1) model explained below. The simulation process tests the reliability of the system under the stochastic environment, allowing the estimation of optimal operating rules. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed. The Objective Function An agricultural sector model consists of, at least, a two-level optimization problem. First, is the problem of optimally allocating public resources under set goals and constraints, and second is the problem of predicting farmers' response. In most cases, the farmer's maximization problem is simplified by estimating 'reaction' or 'behavioral' functions. In terms of the first problem, it would be ideal if economic policy could be chosen based on a single, well-established objective. But there are often conflicting goals and objectives, and public policy is often formulated on the basis of a qualitative integration of numerous economic, political, social, and technological objectives. Therefore, it could be 4 argued that the objective function for the agricultural sectoral model should be a weighted set of policy objectives, both economic and non-economic. In India, most major irrigation investment are made by government or quasi-government units, and their activities are guided by national and state agency, and constituency objectives. Given the various objectives of GOI and provided that they try to satisfy their constituents while operating under budget constraints, the objective function for the Indian model is defined as a government expedition function. This function can be considered as an approximation of the consumer and producer surplus function, since most of the model's components represent government subsidies.1 Even a deviation from the ""ideal"" objective function, from the economic point of view, can be permitted because the optimization model provides only initial optimal values which are later tested under a stochastic environment using a simulation model. The Optimization Model The model disaggregates irrigation into two types of irrigation investment; (1) irrigation by minor schemes which involves a large private investment component ( = 1) and (2) irrigation by major and medium schemes which are based primarily on government investments 0 =2). In India, this classification corresponds fairly closely to the classification 'When society's objective function includes only economic efficiency goals, Samuelson (1952) has shown that there exists a maximization model that will simulate the market outcome under conditions with downward-sloping demand functions. The optimum is achieved when the sum of producer and consumer surplus is maximized. Yet the optimum level found with optimization models represents a partial equilibrium rather than a general equilibrium. Using a general equilibrium model requires numerous simplifying assumptions and other complications (Norton and Scandizzo, 1981). 5 by source; ground water and surface water irrigation. The only major exception is tank (small reservoir) irrigation, which is included in minor irrigation and is important in South India. The model also allows for investment to rehabilitate existing major and medium irrigation systems. Because of the wide diversity that exists in a country as large as India, the model includes the seventeen major agricultural states and divides them into six regions (i = 1,...,6). 2 The regional classification is based on contiguity, net irrigated area and foodgrain production, and is the same as the one used by Sarma and Gandhi, 1989, in their study of foodgrains in India. The diversity among regions is exemplified by the Southern Collapse"

108714,1991,economic journal,basing point pricing and production concentration,basing point pricing and production concentration,"Basing point pricing is a delivered price system in which the price quoted for delivery of a commodity is the sum of the price quoted at a predetermined basing point plus the cost of transportation from the basing point to the point of delivery, whether or not the commodity is actually shipped from the basing point. Thus, a seller who is not located at the base site absorbs freight for shipments toward the base point and charges phantom freight on shipments away from the base point. Basing-point pricing has been widely practiced throughout the world. For example, testimony of the Federal Trade Commission before the TNEC (I 94 I, p. 33) alleged that industries in the United States which then or previously followed basing-point pricing included: lumber, iron and steel, pig iron, cement, lime, brick, asphalt, shingles and roofing, window glass, white lead, metal lath, building tile, floor tile, gypsum, plaster bolts, nuts and rivets, cast iron, soil pipe, range boilers, valves and fittings, sewer pipes, paper and paper products, salt, sugar, corn derivatives, industrial alcohol, linseed oil, fertilisers, chemicals, transportation equipment, and power cable. Almost from its inception, economists have generally considered basingpoint pricing to reflect a cartel or price leadership arrangement (Hoover, I937; Stigler, I949; Machlup, I949) and such practices have been attacked under antitrust statutes; for example, Aetna Portland Cement Co. vs. FTC, I 57 F. 2nd 533 (I946), Triangle Conduit Cable Co. vs. FTC, i68 F. 2nd I 75, 7th Cir. (I 948), Cement Institute vs. FTC, I57 F. 2nd 533 (I948). Nonetheless, basing-point pricing remains prevalent, particularly outside the United States. OPEC has used a Gulf-based price plus transport costs to determine the delivered prices of crude oil to most places in the world, Haddock (i982, p. 290), the pricing of cement in Great Britain and steel in Europe can be characterised as multibase point systems: Greenhut (I987). Recent attempts by, for example, Haddock (i982) to return to the theme that the basing-point system could be competitive and desirable have been challenged by Thisse and Vives (i988), and Benson et al. (I990) on the basis of recent advances in the analysis of pricing policy. Given, then, that we assume basing-point pricing to be a collusive device adopted by incumbent firms to impose some kind of price discipline on potential entrants the price leadership point referred to above important strategic and locational issues arise. In particular, a major concern of the early analysis of basing-point pricing was the effect such a pricing policy would have on location choice of entrant firms. Collapse"

The Government's own analysis, set out in a Green Paper issued at the start of i986,2 stressed the efficiency objectives of the package of reforms. The previous system, in the Green Paper's words, had been one in which the 'accountability' of local authorities had been weak because of 'differences ... among those who vote for, those who pay for, and those who receive local government services'. Taken together, the two major reforms introduced in England and Wales in April io990,3 the ending of local control over business rates and the introduction of the Community Charge, aimed to ensure that the full cost of local spending at the margin would in future be borne entirely by the local electorate. A second group of important issues about the Community Charge centres on the question of equity. The new arrangements for local government finance have involved a significant redistribution of the burden of local household taxation, both between different household types and between areas. The pattern of gains and losses has attracted considerable interest, although the complexity of the reforms has made it difficult to pin down responsibility for particular changes in taxation levels. The lump sum character of the new tax has been a more specific focus of discussion. Is it fair for local government to be financed by a poll tax or, at the very least, is the new system fairer than the old one? This paper addresses these issues in three sections. The first presents some basic information about the distributional characteristics of domestic rates and of the new Community Charge. Section III considers a number of arguments about how equity considerations should affect the choice of taxes for local government. Finally, in Section IV, some possible reforms, which would relate local taxes more closely to household incomes, are briefly examined. Collapse"

The first publication on the issue of COIs dates back to more than a century, but only in the last decades the related ethical and legal problems have received public and professional attention. The growing role of industry in biomedical research, the significant decrease in public contributions to health, care, training, and research, and the involvement of physicians in industry-funded research have obliged to study how to identify and manage COIs. The Bioethics and Palliative Care Study Group of the Italian Neurological Society addressed the issue with a specific focus on Scientific Societies that, in our opinion, should also set an example for individual practice, raising awareness among their associates on COIs and implementing strategies for their identification and management. The paper is focused on the nature of the COI, why and how it could be managed, which policies can be implemented, and which kind of action should be considered by Scientific Societies. We emphasize the role of Scientific Societies in fostering knowledge and awareness of conflicts of interest through training and continuing education. Collapse"

Today that model is obsolete. It inevitably degrades the quality of service a company can provide by setting in motion a cycle of failure that produces dissatisfied customers, unhappy employees, high turnover among both--and so lower profits and lower productivity overall. The cycle starts with human resource policies that minimize the contributions frontline workers can make: jobs are designed to be idiot-proof. Technology is used largely for monitoring and control. Pay is poor. Training is minimal. Performance expectations are abysmally low. Today companies like Taco Bell, Dayton Hudson, and ServiceMaster are reversing the cycle of failure by putting workers with customer contact first and designing the business system around them. As a result, they are developing a model that replaces the logic of industrialization with a new service-driven logic. This logic: Values investments in people as much as investments in technology--and sometimes more. Uses technology to support the efforts of workers on the front lines, not just to monitor or replace them. Makes recruitment and training crucial for everyone. Links compensation to performance for employees at every level. To justify these investments, the new logic draws on innovative data such as the incremental profits of loyal customers and the total costs of lost employees. Its benefits are becoming clear in higher profits and higher pay--results that competitors bound to the old industrial model will not be able to match. Collapse"

At a pre-analytic level it is based on the simple intuition that market mechanisms are inherently dynamically unstable, at least around their stationary positions. In this note, I want to stress the theoretical point that there is nothing in the working of a perfectly competitive market system that prevents it from displaying persistent and endogenous fluctuations and that, moreover, such fluctuations may have their origins in market fundamentals such as factor intensities, factor substitutability, degree of impatience, and so forth. Nevertheless, macroeconomic models of endogenous fluctuations still have to prove that, apart from being very beautiful, they can also be useful to understand the so-called heal world’: hit sunt leones. This article is not intended to be a survey of all that has been written in this area in the last decade. I have no title whatsoever to talk about empirical studies: Chera Sayers’ contribution in this same volume addresses that guestion.

The measurements are based on proton-proton collision data produced at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 20 fb$^{-1}$ for each experiment. The measurements used events containing one lepton and having different jet multiplicities in the final state. The results are quoted as fractions of W bosons with longitudinal ($F_0$), left-handed ($F_\mathrm{L}$), or right-handed ($F_\mathrm{R}$) polarizations. The resulting combined measurements of the polarization fractions are $F_0 =$ 0.693 $\pm$ 0.014 and $F_\mathrm{L} =$ 0.315 $\pm$ 0.011. The fraction $F_\mathrm{R}$ is calculated from the unitarity constraint to be $F_\mathrm{R} = -$0.008 $\pm$ 0.007. These results are in agreement with the standard model predictions at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics and represent an improvement in precision of 25 (29)% for $F_0$ ($F_\mathrm{L}$) with respect to the most precise single measurement. A limit on anomalous right-handed vector ($V_{\text{R}}$), and left- and right-handed tensor ($g_{\text{L}},g_{\text{R}}$) tWb couplings is set while fixing all others to their standard model values.

Measures to protect the marine environment often result in these wastes being moved from place to place or transformed into another type of pollution, creating new and different hazards. Of the many marine conventions, only afew contain a provision to guard against such transfers and transformation of pollutants.

NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL have been taken for granted; yet it could have profound implications for the environment as a whole and for the way in which states manage the production, use, and disposal of environmentally harmful substances. Article 195 refers to an increasingly. worrisome problem-that pollutants do not stay where they arise or are put. They move from one place to another and from one medium of the environment to another, degrading and contaminating whatever they come in contact with, be it air, land, or water.5 Transfers and transformation of pollutants can even happen, and are happening more and more often, as an unexpected and unwanted byproduct of action taken to protect a part of the environment. They show how complex the interrelationships within the physical environment are and how difficult it is to regulate waste management so as to prevent such unpleasant surprises. This article will: (1) describe some of the dilemmas posed by the conflicting requirements of international and national rules for the disposal of wastes in various media; and (2) outline an integrated regional land and water program that could mitigate adverse effects from the balancing of waste disposal options inherent in measures such as Article 195 of the Law of the Sea Convention. Effects of Regulation on Pollution Transfers Into and Out of the Marine Environment The sea has long been used (or abused) as the ultimate repository of wastes of many kinds and from many sources. ""There is only one pollution,"" oceanographer Jacques Cousteau pointed out, .""because every single thing, every chemical whether in the air or on land will end up in the ocean."" 6That reference to the complex workings of the hydrologic cycle was echoed in a Council of Europe resolution which declared landbased pollution to be ""the main factor in marine pollution, yet one of the least controlled at international and national levels, owing to the ease of using the sea as a universal refuse dump."" 7 To redress this sorry state of affairs, more multilateral conventions have been promulgated within the past two decades for protection of the oceans than for any other single element of the global environment. They govern pollution of the sea by oil and chemicals, the dumping of wastes by ships, 5.

All of these conventions are very comprehensive instruments and collectively cover enormous ocean areas, but not one contains a provision like that in Article 195 of the Law of the Sea Convention. Their compartmentalization of pollution control, combined with quite detailed instructions as to what may be disposed of, where and how, has produced some bizarre results.

The paper rejects the frequently-made claim that the proposed abolition in 1992 of Article 115 of the Treaty of Rome (which prevents free intra-EC circulation of third country goods) will have a liberalizing effect. This is a general point. In particular, the paper analyses changes over time in the restrictiveness of existing VERs on Hong Kong clothing, focusing on the VERs' impact on import tariff equivalents, rents transferred and intra-EC price dispersion. The paper reports estimates of the relationship between home-country income growth, exporting-country supply conditions and the import tariff equivalents of VERs. This estimated relationship is used to forecast the increased restrictiveness of VERs caused by the `internal market's' tendency to boost import demand. Finally, the paper outlines the likely consequences of opening up Eastern Europe: the impact promises to be considerable. Collapse"
108894,1991,european economic review,economic integration and market access,economic integration and market access,"Traditional analysis of the effect of economic integration on the rest of the world draws unambiguously pessimistic conclusions. Integration causes trade diversion which reduces demand for the rest of the world’s exports, and reduces supply of its imports. The rest of the world’s terms of trade may therefore deteriorate with associated welfare loss. As is widely recognised, this analysis gives an inadequate description of the current phase of European integration. Study of European integration must incorporate imperfect competition, scale economies and intra-industry trade. The implications of these considerations for the effect of economic integration on the rest of the world have been discussed by Corden (1972), Robson (1987), Pelkmans (1984) and, in the context of the effects of 1992 on EFTA, Norman (1989). These considerations raise the possibility that consumers in the rest of the world may benefit from integration; supply side improvements in the integrating economy (for example lower marginal costs if there are increasing returns to scale, or the production of more product varieties) may spill over into rest of the world markets. However, the effects of integration on firms in the rest of the world is again negative they suffer reduced market shares and perhaps lower profits. This is illustrated in Smith and Venables ( 1988). The second way in which current European integration is not adequately described by traditional theory is that the integration process is not the removal of taxes and tariffs, but the alteration of rules and regulations.

108895,1991,european economic review,from common fish to rights based fishing:  fisheries management and the evolution of exclusive rights to fish,from common fish to rights based fishing fisheries management and the evolution of exclusive rights to fish,"Abstract Since the Second World War the international Law of the Sea has been altered fundamentally. An exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) extending 200 nautical miles from baselines has been established, in which the coastal states have practically full sovereignty over natural resources including fish. This development appears explicable in the light of the economic theory of property rights, due to increased scarcity of fish and lower costs of supporting claims to fish resources. The EEZ has major implications for the efficient utilization of fish resources through its limitation of free access. In some cases it amounts to the establishment of national property rights to fish resources, while in others the number of parties with a legitimate claim to access has been restricted. In the wake of this, fisheries management by total allowable catches (TACs) has become widespread. This method of management has a potential for increasing the efficiency of fisheries. Given that a single state, or a group of states, are able to control the fishery, how should this be done to ensure efficiency? Four methods are discussed: (i) Privatization of the resources; (ii) taxes on landings or fishing activity; (iii) fishing licences, and (iv) individual transferable quotas (ITQs). Some questions related to ITQs are discussed; (i) fixed ITQs versus shares in the TAC; (ii) stable versus variable ITQs; and (iii) how the TAC should be set for each particular year. The economic theory of property rights predicts the emergence of private property rights to fish stocks or fishing rights in the present situation. Recent cases of such rights emerging are discussed.

The paper forwards the proposition that Pigovian taxes do not constitute a feasible method for fisheries management due to their huge data requirements. It appears, on the other hand, that the fundamental production externalities in ocean fisheries may in many cases be eliminated by instituting an appropriately designed system of property rights. A particular management method based on individual property rights in the fishery and discussed in the paper is not only capable of restoring economic efficiency in valuable ocean fisheries, it is also extremely informationally efficient in the sense that very little centralized collection of information is required for its operation. A further important advantage of this particular method is that it generalizes in a straightforward manner to multispecies fisheries. It appears, moreover, that this approach may also be applied to other cases of inefficient use of common natural resources. Collapse"

Governments are responding with unemployment benefit schemes which may be seen as a natural and positive complement to economic reform. At the same time, compensation for the unemployed is often viewed in a negative light in Western Europe with the 1980s having been a period of retrenchment in the face of higher levels of unemployment. This contrast between East and West is used in the paper to stimulate reconsideration of principles of income support for the unemployed. Given that any civilised society would wish to provide for the unemployed, what form should compensation for unemployment take? The paper considers the choice between contributory unemployment insurance and means-tested unemployment assistance, stressing the positive aspects for labour markets of the former. How should schemes in Western Europea be revised? Do the schemes currently emerging in Eastern Europe make sense in the light of both the particular circumstances of the change occuring in Eastern European economies, and the experience with the operation of different schemes in Western Europe and other OECD countries?

Comparisons and contrasts of policies adapted during two periods, from 1921 to 1990 and from 1990 to the present day, are made. Some recommendations and suggestions are drawn at the end of the paper. The history of the Mongolian education system can be divided into two phases. The first phase can be referred to as the socialist-era education period, which spans from 1991 Independence Revolution until 1990 Democratic Revolution. The second phase is from 1990 Democratic Revolution to the present day which can be defined as the free-market period education system. in every aimag (province) center and local soums (the smallest municipal unit). Currently, in Mongolia there are 22 aimags and 335 soums. In addition to the capital city Ulaanbaatar, which is a home to 1.2 million residents, there are two major cities Darkhan and Erdenet, both of which are major industrial hubs for the country. Now there are several schools in each aimag center and a school in all soums. By the time the Soviet Union collapsed in 1990, the Mongolian public education system had become a rather mature system. Despite some weaknesses, the country had developed a solid educational foundation to build on. During the socialist era, Mongolia adapted the Soviet style education. Although many critics argue that the th Mongolian education system in the 20 century had problems such as political prejudice, the positive aspects heavily uring the socialist era period the Dfoundation for the current education system of Mongolia was formed. During this time of history, traditional Mongolian lifestyle had taken a drastic turn. Majority of Mongolians were nomadic. The only semi-formal education offered were through Buddhist temples. After 1921 revolution, cities, large new industrial, educational, and cultural centers, were created. An education became mandatory for everyone and the nomadic families were required to send their children to school. Various ages grouped in the same classroom and classes were taught in gers, the traditional yurt tents. The compulsory nature of the education and penalties imposed on the parents for not sending their children to school, forced the a endance rate to increase rapidly. Curriculums have developed, school buildings were built SOCDEM ASIA QUARTERLY October 2014 22 outweigh the problems. The most remarkable achievement was the total eradication of illiteracy. The natural sciences were integrated into curriculum. Subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology, zoology and plants, geography were taught, and the state exams were instituted upon graduation from various levels for regular evaluation. Due to political situation, social sciences courses such as history and ethics were strongly skewed to reflect the centralized, the communist party controlled views. However, the quality of the natural science classes was excellent. Beginning from the 1960s, the Mongolian students began to participate successfully in International mathematics and physics Olympiads. The academic institutions and universities were established and the country's scientific research base was created. The leading universities of today, the National University of Mongolia, the Mongolian University of Science and Technology, the Medical Sciences University, and the Universities of Pedagogy, Agriculture, and Veterinarian medicine can date their establishment back to the socialistera. After the World War II and the establishment of the National University of Mongolia, the country adapted the industrialization policy which triggered the opening of numerous vocational and technical training colleges. The former herders became the factory workforce. Those who excelled academically went on to get the university degree while the large majority of graduates joined the vocational colleges and integrated into the skilled labor force. The National Academy of Sciences, with its member institutes, also constitutes the back bone of the country's scientific and technical base even today. Thousands of graduates with good academic records went to a end universities in Eastern bloc countries, mostly Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and so on. The vocational training colleges prepared the skilled labor force which was an integral part of the development and industrialization of the era. Thus, the educational system, the universities and vocational colleges, provided the well trained workforce which in turn enabled the industrialization and development of Mongolia. Under the socialist system, all costs of higher education were fully subsidized by the government. The government was involved in policymaking, planning, and development of the entire higher education system from the date of its foundation. A number of ministries shared responsibilities for education and all educational institutions were subject to applicable laws, regulations, policies and plans. University graduates were fully employed in accordance with the plan. In theory, unemployment was nonexistent. The eventual retirement of all state-employees and guaranteed pension gave people confidence and predictable future. The beginning of the second phase of the education system may be marked by the Democratic Revolution in 1990 to the present day. The Democratic Revolution of 1990 brought in changes in the education system, most notably the private education enterprises. The curricula for the social sciences, including course materials in history, political sciences, and philosophy were changed dramatically. English became the primary foreign language, replacing the mandatory Russian language classes. Until 1990, the secondary education was for ten years which included 8-18 year olds. The system went through several changes to 11year system to the current 12-year system. Rapid growth has occurred in a number of non-traditional providers of education, offering predominantly foreign languages, business courses and non-degree programs. The major shift to allow private educational enterprises had significant impact on the quality of education and applicability of the skills of college graduates. Currently there are several dozen private schools emerged in Mongolia, mostly located in the capital city Ulaanbaatar. The tuition rates for the private schools range from 1000 to 35000 US dollars per annum. The The only semi-formal education offered were through Buddhist temples. After 1921 revolution, cities, large new industrial, educational, and cultural centers, were created. An education became mandatory for everyone and the nomadic families were required to send their children to school. SOCDEM ASIA QUARTERLY October 2014 23 quality of education in private schools exceeds public schools, perhaps due to higher pay offered to a ract be er teachers. The higher education is also comprised of public and private universities and institutions. Even at public universities, students now pay tuition, which is a major difference compared to the previous era. During this second phase, effectively teachers' salary went down compared to the rate of rise for the average income. In 1990s, the strike was common among teachers. As of 1999, many teachers were leaving the profession in order to pursue be er paying jobs. (Rossabi, 2003) In the socialist period being a teacher yielded a great deal respect and higher salary. The respect for teacher's job is continuing to decline. The current paradox in Mongolia is that there are some 150 universities and institutes in Mongolia, for a population of 3 million. The high number does not necessarily reflect a be er quality, and nearly 50 percent of recent graduates with bachelors degree are without jobs and many graduates have no choice but work in low-skill jobs such as waitress or store clerk. The tuition fee is an important source of income for universities. The state offers loans to help students. The state also provides low cost dormitories to the students. However, this model based on the tuition revenue causes the institutes to focus their priority only on the number of students over the quality of education, and as a consequence there are a large of number of university graduates today without a job and useful skills. The 1991 Education Law of Mongolia, a series of education laws adopted in 1995 and amended in 1998, 2000 and 2002, and numerous executive orders by the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture (MOSEC) were clearly responses to changes in the higher education environment. Since the adoption of the first Education Act, there has been a significant expansion of private higher education providers. The creation of private universities and tuition pay system was adapted during when the Democratic Party was in power. The Mongolian People's Party (MPP), as a social democratic party, has consistently adapted policies to increase the teacher's pay. Frequent change in the direction and policy, a empts at adapting of various models (Russian-style, British-style, Americanstyle, and the latest one the so-called “Student-centered” style and so on) are causing general confusion. In conclusion, although the current education system in Mongolia has many flaws, still, some of the key strengths do exist and the system is on recovery from decline (Engel 2014). The recommendations to improve the system may include the teacher pay increase, policy to allocate more funds to education, adapt supportive policy to encourage public and private sector funding for scientific research, protection of intellectual property right and profit sharing mechanism in order to support innovation in the higher education organizations. Perhaps the most important is the concerted effort to increase the respect for the teacher's profession, including higher salary, in order to a ract the best and the brightest graduates to join the Collapse"
108900,1991,european economic review,on gradual monetary reform,on gradual monetary reform,"Abstract In this paper, a time-varying parameters (TVP) model is used to evaluate the effectiveness of economic reform in an economy in transition. It is constructed using a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) methodology. This approach allows us to deal, to some extent, with the problem of continuously changing short- and intermediate-run relations. The model explains interrelations between prices (both state-controlled and free market), money demand, households' incomes and internal foreign exchange rates. The five-equation SVAR system is formulated and estimated for Poland using quarterly data for 1971–1991. The general specification of the model and discussion of the structural restrictions imposed is followed by an overview of the estimation results. The model is used to simulate: (i) a policy of price liberalisation, (ii) direct expansionary monetary policy and (iii) the comparison of fast and slow privatisation policies. The general outcome of these experiments seems to favour a decisive, although gradual approach to economic reform. Collapse"

ICUs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face many challenges that could affect patient outcome.AimTo describe differences between resource-poor and resource-rich settings regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, economics and research aspects of sepsis. We restricted this manuscript to the ICU setting even knowing that many sepsis patients in LMICs are treated outside an ICU.FindingsAlthough many bacterial pathogens causing sepsis in LMICs are similar to those in high-income countries, resistance patterns to antimicrobial drugs can be very different; in addition, causes of sepsis in LMICs often include tropical diseases in which direct damaging effects of pathogens and their products can sometimes be more important than the response of the host. There are substantial and persisting differences in ICU capacities around the world; not surprisingly the lowest capacities are found in LMICs, but with important heterogeneity within individual LMICs. Although many aspects of sepsis management developed in rich countries are applicable in LMICs, implementation requires strong consideration of cost implications and the important differences in resources.ConclusionsAddressing both disease-specific and setting-specific factors is important to improve performance of ICUs in LMICs. Although critical care for severe sepsis is likely cost-effective in LMIC setting, more detailed evaluation at both at a macro- and micro-economy level is necessary. Sepsis management in resource-limited settings is a largely unexplored frontier with important opportunities for research, training, and other initiatives for improvement. Collapse"

Generally speaking, evidence to the contrary seems to prevail. namely that trade in textiles is becoming more restrictive. While this paper shows that there can be no doubt about textile product exports from LDCs to ICs having made substantial inroads into IC markets — perhaps liberalization in a de facto sense? - it also notes that the forthcoming negotiations about an extension or elimination of the MFA are — at least as concerns the EC in connection with its common internal market — beset with formidable stumbling blocks. In particular it is pointed out that the strictly—controlled individual country quotas within the EC represent a real threat to de jura trade liberalization. Nonetheless, at the same time it can be hardly be overlooked — as is portrayed in this paper - that these quotas harbor a potential to considerably increase consumers' welfare in the EC. The question is then examined as to how consumers' welfare can be more effectively counterbalanced against those of producers' in order to ensure that the benefits of liberalization are more easily realized.

108911,1991,european economic review,the experience with liberalization policies:  the case of the agricultural sector,the experience with liberalization policies the case of the agricultural sector,"Abstract Agriculture is one of the most protected sectors in most industrialized countries. The economic costs of protecting agriculture have increased over the last 20 years and there is certainly a growing need to liberalize, at least from an economist's point of view. However, policy makers have rejected liberalization policies so far in most countries. Farmers have fought for protection more successfully than other interest groups because of sectoral factors which bias the political market in their favor. Protection rates are widely used to measure protectionism. However, protection rates are not always meaningful indicators of the results of liberalization policies if world market prices change over time. A decline in protection rates does not necessarily reflect a government's decision to support farm income less. Hence, a reasonable indicator of a liberalization policy should inform whether a government has accepted a decline in agricultural income and an increase in pressure to adjust. Determinants of liberalization policies are discussed and some cross-country empirical evidence is provided. Actual liberalization of agricultural policies in industrialized countries has only been instituted in exceptional cases (New Zealand, and most recently Sweden). The experience gained in New Zealand is compared with expectations based on economic models. The Common Agricultural Policy of the EC has undergone some liberalization over the last 5 years. Effects are discussed in the paper. The paper ends with a section on ‘unilateral versus multilateral liberalization policies’. Collapse"
108913,1991,european economic review,transition to a market economy:  the case of czechoslovakia,transition to a market economy the case of czechoslovakia,"ConclusionThe privatisation and liberalisation steps referred to are an expression of the endeavour to accompany stabilisation efforts as quickly as feasible with the institutional and systemic changes as well as with policies for restructuring, to change the behaviour patterns of economics agents. Until this change takes place, the more effective the restrictive policies are in the financial sphere, the higher the costs incurred in the real sphere will tend to be.The achievement of the desirable trade-offs between the conflicting aims of the macroeconomic development is thus linked with the degree of success in the changes of behaviour of economic agents. The macroeconomic stabilisation will therefore in the longer run depend on the extent to which the regime actually changes, on the positive “destabilisation” of economic agents and on the progress in their restructuring.In Czechoslovakia there does not therefore seem to be as clear-cut a distinction, as in other reforming countries, between the phases of stabilisation policies, institutional and systemic changes and those of the restructuring policies.The measures to transform the Czechoslovak economy and the implementation of these measures represent an attempt to proceed on a wider front, to take coordinated steps in all the relevant spheres, implying a greater degree of simultaneity. This is a reflection of the strategy chosen which aims at a qualitative change to be accomplished rapidly, taking into account the fact that the individual steps in the various spheres of the transition process are closely interconnected. The approach followed could thus be considered a strategy to introduce groups of complementary policy measures, that is to say, to make several reform packages and to implement them sequentially.

108937,1991,european economic review,international trade with endogenous technological change,international trade with endogenous technological change,"To explain why trade restrictions sometimes speed up worldwide growth and sometimes slow it down, we exploit an analogy with the theory of consumer behavior. substitution effects make demand curves slope down, but income effects can increase or decrease the slope, and can sometimes overwhelm the substitution effect. We decompose changes in the worldwide growth rate into two effects (integration and redundancy) that unambiguously slow down growth, and a third effect (allocation) that can either speed it up or slow it down. We study two types of trade restrictions to illustrate the use of this decomposition. The first is across the board restrictions on traded goods in an otherwise perfect market. The second is selective protection of knowledge-intensive goods in a world with imperfect intellectual property rights. In both examples, we show that for trade between similar regions such as Europe and North America, the first two effects dominate; starting from free trade, restrictions unambiguously reduce worldwide growth.

If the economy simultaneously experiences cyclical change, however, the change in trend can be difficult to identify. A useful example is presented by the debate about Canada’s early 20th century growth spurt, the “wheat boom.” Was the wheat boom a particularly exuberant upward cycle, or did it mark the beginning of a new and fundamentally different growth process (Hartland, 1955)? In a macroeconomic context this question is recognized as a problem of correctly decomposing a time series into trend and cyclical movements (Stock and Watson, 1988). Perron (1989) has proposed a technique to determine if exogenous shocks derived from war, technological innovation, or other international market changes were sufficiently powerful to alter the underlying trend rate of growth. Use of this technique on Canada’s new national income data over the period from 1870 to 1985 leads to the conclusion that the wheat boom and each of the two World Wars created a structural break in the growth process and that no other exogenous shock had a comparable impact. In the next section we provide a brief synopsis of Canadian growth between 1870 and 1985. In Section III we outline the technique used to determine if particular shocks had the effect of changing the trend rate of growth; technical aspects of the procedure are confined to an appendix.

Using the Geographic Profile on Employment and Unemployment, published by the U.S. Department of Labor, we examine occupational data across the nine census divisions continuously from 1983 through 1988. This data source is unique because it reports on occupational data annually, in relatively disaggregate form, and does so by geographic regions. Location quotients for the occupational data serve to identify a “core” with respect to concentrations of control-related activity. This core comprises the New England, Middle Atlantic, and Pacific divisions. In contrast, routine activity generally is more dispersed, although some regional separation is evident for specific occupations, showing regional concentration in subordinate or “peripheral” regions. The results of the study identify regional patterns, which are heuristically valuable in raising questions regarding the complex processes responsible for spatial divisions of labor. In particular, the findings suggest a geography of modes of production, a subject that requires substantially more attention. Collapse"

In this study, we explore the dynamic relationships among several potentially relevant time series variables and develop appropriate models for forecasting. It is apparent that the temperature of service areas and the price of natural gas are important factors in forecasting the residential consumption of natural gas. Because of the government price control policy, however, we find that the price variable employed in modeling and forecasting of natural gas consumption needs to be used judiciously. Otherwise, inappropriate models and poor forecasts may occur. We also study the inclusion of the price variable using an intervention model and an outlier detection and adjustment method. We find both approaches provide more accurate forecasts and reveal useful information on the dynamics of the controlled variable. Both monthly and quarterly time series of the data are studied. We find it is easier to obtain appropriate models using quarterly data. However, the performance of quarterly models may not be as good as that of monthly models. In this study, however, we find the loss of performance efficiency in using quarterly data is not too great. This is probably due to the fact that the consumption of natural gas is subjected to moving holiday effects and the use of quarterly data may conveniently avoid such systematic disturbances. Both the traditional ccf method and the ltf method for transfer function model identification are employed in this study, we find the ltf method is more efficient and easier to use than the ccf method.

109162,1991,journal of accounting research,collusion in auditing,collusion in auditing,"In April 1991, a radical programme of public health care reform was introduced by the Conservative Government. The avowed intention of the programme was to improve the overall quality of health care whilst simultaneously moderating the growth in costs. Within the general reform package, prescribing in general practice was a particular focus of attention. The preparatory White Paper (CM 555, 1989) noted that prescription medicines formed the largest single expenditure item for the Family Practitioner Services and observed that the cost of medicines was 'more than the cost of the doctors who wrote the prescriptions' (p.57). In the five preceding years, the cost of drugs had risen at tour per cent per annum over the rate of inflation. The central framework of the government's reform programme was the internal market, or the 'purchaser-provider split', entailing a necessarily prominent role for devolved budgeting. Within general practice, indicative drug budgets were introduced, the intention being to 'place downward pressure on expenditure... without in any way preventing people getting the medicines they need. In this way prescribing can be improved and wasteful expenditure avoided, for the benefit of the NHS as a whole' (p.58). Over and above indicative drug budgets, the government also introduced the voluntary fundholding scheme for general medical practitioners (GPs). A late addition to the reform package, fundholding was always one of the most controversial and most criticised aspects of Conservative health policy. The scheme was introduced without prior appraisal and with minimal consultation. Being untested, no contemporary evidence was available on the potential costs or benefits to the health service, to patients or to the general practitioners who were to operate the scheme. As fundholders' budgets covered their anticipated prescribing expenditures, consequences for prescribing were to be expected. Even after seven years, our knowledge base with respect to the effects of budgeting, especially fundholding, on prescribing in general practice remains limited, and is based on independent academic studies and a few official reports. This document reviews and draws conclusions from the available evidence. The next chapter provides the necessary background to the ensuing discussion, by outlining the nature of the restructuring of public sector health care occasioned by the 1990 NHS Act. The following chapter reviews the series of policy initiatives directed towards prescribing, focusing especially on the fundholding scheme and the parallel indicative prescribing budget scheme initiated for non-fundholders. In Chapter Four, the evidence of independent studies of the effect of budgeting on prescribing is reviewed and evaluated, as are the results of the investigations conducted by the Audit Commission. The document concludes with conjectures as to the future of budgeting and prescribing cost control. A discussion of the impact of budgeting, especially fundholding, on prescribing is particularly pertinent at the present time. Towards the end of its term of office, the Conservative Government mapped out a framework for primary care development (Cm3390, 1996) which appeared to envisage an increasing diversity of organisational forms. Prior to its recent election victory, the Labour Party had been perceived as being antipathetic to fundholding, although early evidence regarding the new government's intentions suggests that fundholding is to be retained whilst new commissioning models are developed (NHS Executive, 1997). Although it is quite conceivable that fundholding in its present form may eventually disappear, it is by no means improbable that any newly-emerging structures (such as locality purchasing) will have much in common with it. An assessment of the successes and failures of prescribing budgets to date can therefore usefully inform the current policy debates. Collapse"

If CEO compensation is related to firm performance because the latter reflects executive performance,' differences in production environment should cause interfirm differences in the relation between CEO compensation and accounting-based firm performance. I focus on this relation because one objective of accounting-the stewardship objective-is to provide information useful in evaluating managers. I examine four kinds of variables which reflect executive performance, taken from discussions by Standard & Poor's industry analysts: stock returns, accounting returns, sales revenue, and net interest income. These variables are examined for banks, electric utilities, oil and gas firms, and retail groceries between 1978 and 1982.

109165,1991,journal of accounting research,employee compensation and firms' research and development activity,employee compensation and firms research and development activity,"Small firms created more than six million new jobs in the United States in the 1980s. During the same period, Fortune 500 firms reduced employment by more than a million (Holt 1993). In recent years, small firms have accounted for nearly 90 percent of the net new jobs added in the U.S. (Mathis and Jackson 1991). Since small firms employ nearly half of the American workforce (Holley and Wolters 1987), their success is critical for the economy. To be successful in a global market, a small firm needs a highly motivated, skilled and satisfied workforce that can produce quality goods at low costs (Holt 1993). However, to develop such a workforce, a firm has to implement an appropriate human resource management (HRM) strategy. Unlike large businesses, published research further indicates that recruiting, motivating, and retaining employees is one of the biggest problems for small firms (Hornsby and Kuratko 1990, Mathis and Jackson 1991, Gatewood and Field 1987, Verser 1987). These findings are substantiated by a recent study (Hess 1987) which reports that small firms ranked personnel management as the second most important management activity (next to general management). However, in practice, other functional areas such as finance, production, and marketing usually get preference over personnel management (McEvoy 1984). Even textbooks on small business management pay considerably more attention to finance, marketing, and planning than personnel management (Hess 1987). Also, researchers report that managers of small firms lack training in formal personnel management practices and they do not consider the use of generally accepted HRM practices as essential for improving productivity (Amba-Rao and Pendse 1985, McEvoy 1984). This lack of understanding of HRM issues and their importance in the operation of a successful business has impacted many small firms. Inadequate and inefficient management of human resources of firms have often resulted in low productivity, and high dissatisfaction and turnover among the employees (Mathis and Jackson 1991). At least one study has found HRM practices to be the leading cause of small firms' failures (McEvoy 1984). However, there is no consensus among researchers regarding the role of HRM in the success of small firms. A study suggesting that training in personnel management is not as critical as training in finance or marketing for small business owners has added to the confusion regarding the importance of HRM practices in small firms (Curran 1988). To resolve this issue, a comparative study of small and large firms is undertaken. LITERATURE REVIEW A good HRM program will recruit, select, motivate, and retain employees who have the required workforce characteristics (Deshpande, Golhar, and Stamm 1993; Saha 1989). A majority of the published research investigating HRM issues in small businesses is conceptual and has concentrated on diverse HRM topics. Maurer and Fay (1986) examined the legal issues involved in employee selection methods used in small business. Gatewood and Field (1987) proposed a model selection program for small business. Fairfield-Sonn (1987) developed a strategic process model to guide the establishment of small business training and development programs. Curran (1988) suggested various training strategies for small business. Fowler and Murlis (1989) proposed compensation systems for small companies. Cosgrove and Dinerman (1982) addressed industrial relations issues in small firms. Holley and Wolters (1987) examined employment-at-will issues in small businesses. Finney (1987) and Smith (1991) addressed personnel challenges faced by HRM managers of small firms and proposed strategies for effective HRM. On the other hand, some empirical work has also been reported in the literature that examines specific aspects of HRM. McEvoy (1984) studied personnel practices of 84 small businesses near a large midwestern metropolitan area and found that small businesses lacked creative staffing practices. … Collapse"

While nearly half of all earnings forecasts are released with revenue forecasts, the motivation for and the effects associated with revenue forecasts are unknown. This paper proposes and tests hypotheses involving the stock price informativeness of both earnings and revenue forecasts. The ""expectations adjustment"" hypothesis advanced by Ajinkya and Gift [1984], and generalized by King, Pownall, and Waymire [1990], predicts that managers release forecasts to align equilibrium prices of common stocks with those of managers. Under this view, both earnings and revenue forecasts are mechanisms by which managers adjust expectations. Since releasing forecasts entails costs, revenue forecasts will accompany earnings forecasts when the latter are insufficient to adjust stock prices consistent with managers' expectations. This yields our paper's primary hypotheses: (1) earnings forecasts released without revenue forecasts are more price informative, and (2) revenue forecasts are price informative.

We show that these schemes are frequently optimal incentive contracts in the presence of moral hazard, and we find that they retain their incentive properties in the presence of several competing managers. For concreteness, our analysis focuses on the problem faced by headquarters (HQ) in evaluating the performance of a cost center manager. In the simplest form of the budget-based schemes, compensation can be expressed as the sum of two terms. The first depends only on a cost estimate (standard) issued by the manager and the second term consists of the difference between estimated and actual cost, multiplied by a proportionality factor which varies with the estimated cost. A budgetbased compensation scheme can then be viewed as a menu of linear compensation functions, each corresponding to a different cost estimate submitted by the manager. In previous work, Ijiri, Kinard, and Putney [1968] discuss an evaluation system based on estimated and actual performance. However, they do not explicitly model preferences, information asymmetries, or moral hazard, and therefore they cannot model the behavior induced by their proposed evaluation scheme or compare alternative evaluation schemes.

This perspective is appropriate, for example, in research on the incentive effects of a compensation plan, because such effects are determined by how the manager's actions affect his valuation of his compensation. In contrast, in a study of the cost-effectiveness of a compensation plan, the shareholders' perspective is appropriate. Measuring the value to a manager of his compensation is difficult because some of the diverse components of compensation packages (e.g., executive stock options and restricted stock) have payoffs that are uncertain when the compensation is granted. In most empirical studies, each component is valued independently (without consideration of the structure of the compensation package as a whole), and these values are summed. Moreover, the values are frequently determined using formulas for publicly traded securities with ""similar"" payoff structures (i.e., from the perspective of security market participants). Market imperfections create divergence between managers' and shareholders' valuations of a component of a compensation scheme. In particular, moral hazard and adverse selection issues cause shareholders to tie Collapse"

This measure allows us to examine the dynamics of an ex-ante time-series for the risk premium in the market. The VAR model produces 'better' forecasts than the survey responses for turbulent periods such as 1981-1982 and 1984-1985. The VAR-generated expectations are then used to construct a risk premium time-series. This risk premium ieerie series seems to be more reliable than the ones obtained using either survey data on expectations of the future spot exchange rate or the ex-post realized spot exchange rate. Tests on the risk premium series suggest that a risk premium was present, but that it was virtually constant throughout the sample. The conditional variance of the risk premium changed over time, but its unconditional distribution seemed stable across subsamples. Despite these features, the volatility of the series was substantial and varied considerably throughout the sample. Collapse"
109243,1991,journal of development economics,government policy and capability--creating resources in economic growth,government policy and capability  creating resources in economic growth,"Abstract This paper analyzes the transition of an economy specializing in an existing, conventional industry to one also involving a new, high-tech sector (structural change). The conventional industry is characterized by constant returns while the high-tech industry posesses an initial range of resource use characterized by increasing returns, one following from the need of establishing a capability or infrastructure prior to engaging in production. Most of the analysis is static and assumes the existence of only one resource—skills. It focuses on the conditions under which unaided market forces will effect the structural change at the level of resources at which this phenomena is socially desirable. The possibility of market failure is raised, although this is not inevitable since there is scope for skilled wage bargaining and lump sum transfers to the (single) H-entrepreneur. Otherwise, market failure may exist, even when the emerging sector exploits its monopsony power in the skills market. A preliminary discussion of a potential market failure in skill accumulation (rather than allocation) is also presented. The paper presents an attempt to formalize aspects of the ‘structuralist’ perspective to economic growth and development, a perspective which focuses on the relationship between structural change, skill accumulation and economic growth.

Our approach is an extension of the procedure suggested by Hall (1989a) for the case p = 0. We derive the limiting distributions of the instrumental variable estimator when the estimated model is either (i) the true model, (ii) the true model with a shift in mean included, or (iii) the true model with a shift in mean and a linear time trend included. The performance of the test statistics is investigated using a Monte Carlo study. Generally speaking, the criteria based on the instrumental variable approach seem to perform as good as or better than the existing methods when the model is specified correctly. However, if the model is overspecified, then the empirical levels are higher than the nominal level in moderate-sized samples, whereas if the model is underspecified the instrumental variable estimators are inconsistent.

Although Ω and Ω−1 are well known in the literature [see Lillard and Willis (1978)], the derivation of Ω −1 2 has many advantages: (i) It transforms GLS into a WLS procedure and, therefore, simplifies the computation. (ii) It provides natural estimates of the variance components. (iii) The transformation obtained can be easily extended to handle more general error processes on the remainder disturbances. This is illustrated for the AR(1) model, AR(2) model, and the specialized AR(4) model for quarterly data. Also, for the AR(1) model, this transformation is extended to handle alternative assumptions on the initial observation. This paper also shows that Breusch's (1987) results on maximum-likelihood estimation for the random error-component model extend to the case of serial correlation in the remainder term. This suggests an iterative GLS procedure for obtaining the maximum-likelihood estimates. Collapse"

This is so even in organizations that are described as highly ‘centralized’. It follows that individual members of the organization - I shall call them agents - have some freedom to choose their own actions. If, in addition, there is some divergence among the agents’ goals or objectives, then one can expect some inefficiencies to arise in the organization’s operations. The analysis of these inefficiencies, and the possible remedies by means of organizational design, is the subject of this paper. If the behavior of the agents is ‘rational’ in the sense typically used by economists and decision theorists, then the appropriate formal model would appear to be the theory of games, especially games of incomplete information, as developed in the past two decades.’ This is the methodology that I shall use here, although some aspects of ‘bounded rationality’ will be touched on during the course of my exposition. Furthermore, the relationships among members of an economic organization are typically long-lived, calling for an analysis of dynamic games. Two special paradigmatic models have arisen in the game-theoretic analysis of organization.

It focuses on the value of the professional manager in terms of his control of the economic activities of the firm. This includes the monitoring and decision-making aspects of management when the firm's opportunity set is given. The analysis assumes competitive firms with Cobb-Douglas production functions and fixed capital. Prices, wages, and the value of the market portfolio are described by a system of Ito stochastic differential equations. The primary focus of the model is the determination of marginal managerial value, and its relationship to the parameters of the production, wage, and price processes. The value of managerial control is shown to be an increasing function of the correlation of wages with the aggregate real consumption process and the standard deviation of the growth rate of wages, and a decreasing function of the correlations of wages and output prices and output prices and the market factor (and their standard deviations). Furthermore, the paper demonstrates the difficulty of embedding the managerial input into the production process in a manner consistent with traditional returns to scale concepts. Collapse"

My thesis is that the policies needed to improve the health of the U.S. economy over the next decade or two require a new look at the division of responsibilities between the federal government and the states. In particular, I will argue that the states should have much clearer responsibility for most kinds of public investment, especially for improving the skills of the labor force and upgrading public infrastructure. The federal government should concentrate on a different set of missions, including interaction with the rest of the world, strengthening social insurance, and contributing to national saving by running a surplus in the unified federal budget.

In this crossnational, quantitative study of the determinants of growth of foreign investment and capital penetration, the growth of both phenomena is found to be similar and can be partially explained by common models based on the logic of market orientation. Moreover, such phenomena as foreign capital penetration in manufacturing and overurbanization are positively related to this growth, suggesting that previous research has misspecified certain relationships and that certain elements of the dependentdevelopment approach to dependency theory require refinement or modification. Foreign investment plays a central role in theories and empirical investigations of international development. While conventional perspectives arising from modernization theory view direct, private foreign investment in developing economies as an asset in the developmental struggles of the Third World, newer theories stressing economic dependency and core-periphery relations consider foreign investment the prime culprit in many Third World social ills, such as inadequate labor absorption, overurbanization, lagging fertility decline, and retarded economic growth (Wallerstein 1974; Chase-Dunn 1975; Evans & Timberlake 1980; Timberlake & Kentor 1983; Bornschier & Chase-Dunn 1985; Bradshaw 1987; London 1987, 1988).

A major objective of universal IRAs was to encourage saving for retirement. A spirited debate has ensued over the use of IRA tax deductions as a means of promoting private savings. The crucial policy issue is not whether IRA contributions were substantial; they clearly were, representing about 30 percent of personal savings from 1982 to 1986. Rather the important question is the source of IRA contributions. IRAs can be financed out of 1) tax savings themselves; 2) shifting existing assets into IRAs; 3) borrowing; 4) diverting new savings into IRAs; or 5) reducing consumption. The key question is how much of IRA savings comes from reduced consumption. For overall savings to increase, private savings must increase by more than the tax savings. Conventional economic theory and evidence strongly suggests that IRAs were not effective savings incentives. The challenge to this view rests largely on studies which have appealed to a variety of ""psychological"" factors not normally incorporated in economic analysis. This paper reviews both types of analysis and concludes that the conventional view remains sound. Thus, a dollar devoted to deficit reduction is likely to be a safer bet for increasing savings than a dollar devoted to IRA benefits. Collapse"
109345,1991,journal of economic perspectives,historical research on international lending and debt,historical research on international lending and debt,"A traditional explanation for why sovereign countries repay debt is that they want to keep a good reputation so they can easily borrow more. This explanation does not hold if a country has access to an adequate means of savings regardless of the country’s past actions. With such access, a country gets only transient benefits from maintaining a good relationship with bankers, and such benefits cannot support borrowing. However, if a country is involved in a myriad of trust relationships, the country’s reputation can spill over to a nondebt relationship which has enduring benefits. Such a spillover can allow a country’s reputation to support a large amount of borrowing. The views expressed herein are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis or the Federal Reserve System. Unlike lenders in domestic credit markets, lenders in the international credit market have little recourse if borrowers do not repay debt. There are few direct legal sanctions that can be used against such borrowers, especially when they are sovereign countries. In the 19th century, military invasions were used to enforce international debt repayment, but that sort of thing is no longer done. (See English 1996.) Given this situation, researchers have wondered, why do sovereign countries ever repay debt? An early answer to this question was offered by Eaton and Gersovitz (1981). They argue that sovereign countries may repay their debt because they fear that defaulting on it will tarnish their reputations and thus hinder their ability to borrow in the future. Much work has followed that explanation; see, for example, Kletzer 1984; Manuelli 1986; Grossman and Van Huyck 1988; Atkeson 1991; and Cole, Dow, and English 1995. Recently, however, Bulow and Rogoff (1989b) have challenged this explanation. In a provocative article, they claim to show that “under fairly general conditions, lending to small countries must be supported by the direct sanctions available to creditors, and cannot be supported by a country’s ‘reputation for repayment’” (1989b, p. 43, abstract). A key reason for the difference between this result and the results in the rest of the literature is that Bulow and Rogoff assume that, regardless of a country’s past behavior, it can earn the market rate of return by saving abroad with risk-neutral bankers who can commit to honoring any contracts they sign. The rest of the literature assumes, either explicitly or implicitly, that if a country defaults, it cannot save.† In this article, we reexamine the argument of Bulow and Rogoff (1989b). For clarity’s sake, we state their argument in two parts. First, they claim that a good reputation for repaying loans cannot by itself support lending to a sovereign country. Second, they claim that such lending must be supported by direct sanctions. We find that the first claim holds and provide a simple proof for our model. (They provide a proof in a more general setup.) We find that the second claim does not hold. To disprove it, we construct a model in which there are no direct sanctions on a sovereign country, but in which reputation can support large amounts of lending to that country. We argue that since countries are involved in many different types of relationships, reputation may be able to support debtevenwithBulowandRogoff’sassumption (about the ability to save abroad) if the analysis is expanded from partial reputationmodels, in which debt is viewed in isolation, to ageneral reputationmodel which includes all the country’s relationships. We develop such a general reputation model in which, for simplicity, there is just one other relationship besides the debt relationship. We find that the ability of reputation to support debt in our general reputation model depends critically on the nature of that other relationship. For debt to be supported, the payoffs in the other relationship must provide the country with net benefits from maintaining a good reputation—or reputation spillovers —which, along an equilibrium path, in some sense, both are large enough and last forever. In general, for these net benefits to be calculated, the whole equilibrium must be calculated, and simple conditions cannot be put on the primitives of the environment to ensure that reputation spills over enough to support large levels of debt. In the special, but common, setup in which the other relationship is a simple repeated one, these net benefits are constant, and simple conditions on the primitives of the model can be obtained which ensure that large levels of debt can be supported by spillovers. For brevity’s sake, we will refer to relationships with such large and long-lasting benefits of maintaining a good relationship as relationships withenduring benefits. We will refer to relationships in which, along any equilibrium path, the net benefits from maintaining a good relationship eventually become small as relationships withtransient benefits. We begin by reviewing Bulow and Rogoff’s (1989b) first claim, that in a model of a single debt relationship, there can be no positive debt in equilibrium. We then examine their second claim by adding other relationships to the model. We briefly consider relationships which have transient benefits . We find that even though reputation can spill over from the debt relationship to some other transient benefit relationships, with this type of added relationship there is a unique equilibrium with no debt. Next, we consider adding other relationships which haveenduring benefits . The simplest examples of such relationships are repeated relationships in which the per period benefits from maintaining the relationships are constant. For such relationships, the present value of maintaining a good relationship is necessarily large for high discount factors. Of course, there are more elaborate dynamic relationships with physical state variables which also have enduring benefits. We illustrate how differently spillover works when the other relationship is enduring by considering a model with debt and a simple repeated labor relationship. In the model, reputation spillovers support debt in the sense that certain spillover strategies, which connect behavior in one relationship to behavior in the other, are equilibria. These equilibria have positive debt. Thus, these are xamples of models in which there are no direct sanctions, yet debt can be supported in equilibrium—precisely what Bulow and Rogoff (1989b) claim is not possible. Bulow and Rogoff (1989b) do seem to recognize, however, that there could be exceptions to their claim. At the end of their article, they discuss a trigger strategy model in which a country is playing a tariff game in which either raising tariffs or defaulting on foreign debt triggers a costly trade war. Bulow and Rogoff conjecture that such trigger strategies can potentially support debt, thus invalidating their second claim. One interpretation of our article is that we work out conditions for this conjecture to be true. We find that for it to be true, reputation in the debt relationship must spill over to another relationship with enduring benefits. The main contribution of this article is to give a counterexample to the claim that in a world in which countries can always earn the market rate of return on their savings, lending to small countries must be supported by direct sanctions. A secondary contribution of our article is to exposit a model of a country’s general reputation which is potentially interesting in its own right. Indeed, if one agrees with Bulow and Rogoff’s (1989b) assessment of the data that one way or another the citizens and government of a country in default can always find ways to earn the market rate of return on their investments, then the Bulow and Rogoff (1989b) article essentially kills the standard partial reputation models (and lays the groundwork for the direct sanctions approach adopted by Bulow and Rogoff 1989a and Fernandez and Rosenthal 1990). In that light, one view of our article is that it revives the reputation approach. Moreover, if one agrees with English’s (1996) assessment that the historical evidence for direct sanctions is weak, then currently at least, our general reputation model is the only model in which reputation can support debt. An Economy With One Debt Relationship We begin with an economy that consists of two countries. One country has a number of risk-neutral bankers, who we callSwiss bankers. These bankers can commit to honoring any contracts they sign. The other country is represented by the government, which has access to a country-specific investment project and needs to borrow resources to fund it. We will show that the relationship between the government and the Swiss bankers necessarily has transient benefits for the government. Because of this, there is no equilibrium with positive debt. We prove this result by setting up a contradiction. We suppose to the contrary that there is an equilibrium with positive debt. In such an equilibrium, the government must prefer repaying the debt to defaulting on it. We construct a deviation for the government, from its original strategy, in which it defaults on its debt and improves its welfare, thus contradicting our original supposition. In this deviation, the government will take the money it was supposed to pay back to the bankers and safely save it and earn the market rate of return. To keep the notation simple, we will let the bankers the government originally borrowed from be the same bankers the government saves with after it defaults on its loans. Clearly, the model can be interpreted as having one set of bankers who lend to the government and another set who let the government safely save with them. We will refer to the one set of bankers in the model as Swiss bankers when we want to emphasize that they will allow the government to safely save with them, regardless of the government’s past behavior, and we wil Collapse"

109385,1991,journal of finance,foundations of portfolio theory,foundations of portfolio theory,"This article seeks to evaluate discrimination in home mortgage originations by examining the performance of mortgage loan portfolios. This approach follows from the theoretical foundations of the economics of discrimination (Becker, 1971). The basic premise is that biased lenders will require higher expected profits for loans to minority borrowers and hold minority applicants to underwriting standards in excess of those required for other applicants. Thus discrimination results in lower expected default costs for loans originated for marginally qualified nonminority borrowers. This study employs a rich FHA data set, comprising a large number of individual loan records, to evaluate the performance of mortgage borrowers. Results of the analysis fail to find evidence of better performance on loans granted to minority borrowers. Indeed, black borrowers are found, all else being equal, to exhibit a higher likelihood of mortgage default than other borrowers. These findings argue against allegations of substantial levels of bias in mortgage lending. Many recent studies of mortgage lending activity have documented large and persistent racial disparities, including the provision of information to prospective home loan applicants, mortgage loan instrument selection, and the loan application decision process. (See, for example, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 1991; Canner, Gabriel, and Woolley, 1991; and Munnell, Browne, McEneaney, and Tootell, 1992, hereafter to be referred to as MBMT.) For the most part, findings of those analyses indicate significant race effects that are not well explained by objective factors. Hence the findings have led to allegations of widespread racial discrimination in mortgage lending. This article seeks to evaluate discrimination in home mortgage originations by examining the performance of mortgage loan portfolios. This approach follows from the theoretical foundations of the economics of discrimination (Becker, 1971), which are based on the Cityscape: A Journal of Policy Development and Research • Volume 2, Number 1 • February 1996 U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development • Office of Policy Development and Research Berkovec, Canner, Gabriel, and Hannan 10 Cityscape premise that biased lenders will require higher expected profits from loans to minority applicants. As applied to lending by Richard Peterson (1981), this premise implies that biased lenders may hold minority applicants to more stringent underwriting standards than those required for other applicants. Thus discrimination results in lower expected default costs and higher expected profits for loans originated for marginally qualified minority mortgage borrowers in comparison with those observed for marginally qualified nonminority borrowers. It is important to note that this theory assumes that discrimination against minorities occurs at the margin, affecting those who are near the borderline for creditworthiness, and excludes the possibility that the discrimination is unrelated to credit risk. The theory predicts that this discrimination changes loan performance at the margin. Thus inferences about discrimination that are made from loan performance data must distinguish between average and marginal loan performance. As noted by Peterson (1981) and by Ferguson and Peters (1995), simple comparisons of average loan performance between two groups of borrowers can be misleading if the groups do not exhibit similar distributions of expected returns in the absence of discrimination. If, for example, the proportion of highly qualified nonminority borrowers is substantially higher than that of highly qualified minority borrowers, default rates of nonminority borrowers—observed without controlling for other determinants of credit quality—would be lower than those associated with minority borrowers. This finding, however, would simply reflect the differences in average creditworthiness for the two groups of borrowers and would not necessarily indicate differential underwriting standards. Our study employs a rich Federal Housing Administration (FHA) data set to evaluate the determinants of loan performance as measured by both the likelihood of default and the losses that occur in the event of default. The data consist of a large number of individual loan records recently made available by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). That information is augmented with 1980 and 1990 census tract characteristics to account for neighborhood location attributes associated with default risk. These data are particularly well suited to the investigation, given the vast array of detail concerning characteristics of loans, borrowers, and neighborhoods in which the homes are located. The following section of this article presents the theoretical foundations for the tests of discrimination in mortgage loan performance as they apply to the likelihood of default. The section entitled “Discrimination and Loan Performance” provides a description of the data used in the analysis and empirical specifications of the models. The section entitled “Data and Model Specification” presents the results of model estimations, and the final section provides a summary of the findings. Discrimination and Loan Performance The starting point for our analysis is a simple rationing model of loan origination. One must assume that lenders observe a creditworthiness index (C) for each loan applicant. For our purposes we assume that there is a direct relationship between the level of C for an applicant and the default risk of that applicant. The applicant’s default risk is represented by an expected default probability, D(C), where 0 A + B, Then: CONVENTIONAL LOAN If: A + B > C > F + B', Then: FHA LOAN If: C < F + B', Then: REJECTED APPLICATION where A represents the minimum level of creditworthiness required for approval of a conventional loan, and F is the minimum level necessary for an FHA-insured loan. The values of B and B', assumed to be positive, indicate the degree of discrimination faced by the applicant. Discrimination can occur at either one or both of the two margins. Greater values of B represent increased discrimination in the conventional loan market, while higher levels of B' indicate increased bias in the underwriting of FHA loans. If C were observed directly, discrimination could easily be detected by comparing the minimum levels of C for accepted loans for the borrower groups within each loan type. One could also compare maximum levels of C for conventional loan rejections to identify B, or FHA loans to identify B'. However, outsiders cannot observe the creditworthiness index directly. Our assumption is that outside analysts observe instead a set of characteristics of the loan and applicant that are related to C. Formally, this is expressed as: C = Xβ + e, where X is a vector of observed characteristics, β is a vector of known constants, and e is an error term observable only to the lender. In this framework borrowers with the same observed characteristics X will have different default risks, and get different receptions from lenders, because of differences in the unobservable e. As lenders observe e, the highest default risk applicants at every level of X will be rejected. In the presence of discrimination, the rejection probability of an applicant with characteristics X is given by: d(X) = ∫ f(e) de e < F – Xβ + B' and the probability of approval for an FHA-insured loan is given by: Collapse"

The likelihood of a rating split is higher, and the magnitude of the rating gap is larger, for banks than nonbanks. Moreover, rating agency disagreements are more significant for banks with relatively higher loan and trading securities holdings and maintain lower capital, and for banks engaged in mortgage securitization. Importantly, I find that rating agency disagreements reflect market proxies of information uncertainty. Further, opacity makes external financing more costly. Equity returns surrounding new bond issues are significantly negative on average, and notably lower, when information uncertainty is higher and for banks compared to nonbanks. In the second essay I investigate how corporate governance is related to bank opacity and how bank opacity is related to systematic and systemic risk. It is well known that opaque assets lead to higher systematic risk, which contributes to higher systemic risk. Banks by nature hold a large percentage of opaque assets, but the decision to hold such assets is partly endogenous. Results show that banks with relatively weak corporate governance hold a larger share of opaque assets. Consequently, they operate further along the risk-return frontier and have higher exposure to systemic risk. At the margin, strong corporate governance at publicly traded U.S. banking organizations reduces financial instability. In the third essay I examine if the rating agencies sacrifice the rating timeliness for the sake of rating stability. Credit rating agencies argue that markets expect them to issue stable ratings. Examining equity market reactions around CreditWatch events in 2002-2005, I find that the pursuit of stable rating may have reduced the timeliness of rating changes. Abnormal equity returns of a firm prior to being listed on CreditWatch are effective predictors of the ultimate change in rating that occurs when the firm is delisted. Equity markets exhibit no reaction when a firm is delisted from CreditWatch, suggesting information about the rating change is already reflected in equity prices at the time of delisting.

109487,1991,"journal of law, economics, and organization",using auction theory to inform takeover regulation,using auction theory to inform takeover regulation,"1The Delaware courts’ preference for auctions follows from two premises. First, a firm’s managers should maximize the value of their shareholders’ investment in the company. Second, auctions maximize shareholder returns. The two premises together imply that a target’s board should conduct an auction when at least two firms would bid sums that are nontrivially above the target’s prebid market price. Legal commentators generally share the Delaware courts’ preference for auctions. According to these commentators, the state should pursue efficiency, which here requires a target’s assets to be sold to the highest-valuing possible acquirer at the least cost. An auction is thought best to achieve the efficiency goal (Gilson, 1982). Also, auctions reduce the target shareholders’ collective action problem. This problem may prevent atomized shareholders from getting the highest price (Bebchuk). The broad preference for auctions in the legal community does not rest on serious study of the properties of the typical “takeover auction.” Rather, auction proponents implicitly suppose that takeover auctions are similar to classic English auctions, in which the bidders gather in a room and bid in ascending order until all but one of them drops out. In equilibrium, the winner has the highest valuation for the auctioned object, so English auctions do ensure that the right buyer wins. These auctions also generate high prices because the winner is able to pay the most. Actual takeover auctions differ in material respects from this auction model that dominates legal thought. The desirable properties of English auctions obtain when three assumptions hold. Potential bidders (a) know what, when, and where objects are offered for sale, (b) can costlessly acquire information about the value of the objects being sold, and (c) can bid as often as they like. More formally, bidders have zero search, investigation, and bidding costs. These assumptions imply that the bidder with the highest valuation for the auctioned object always buys it, but none of these assumptions hold in the takeover context. Instead, (a) search costs are positive—it is expensive to find possibly desirable acquisition partners; (b) investigation costs are positive; (c) bidding costs are positive because the forms in which bids must be cast are subject to extensive legal regulation. 2 Collapse"

Liability rules are thought to be called into play when the primary governance mechanisms-board of directors (Williamson), executive compensation (e.g., Smith and Watts), and outside block ownership (Shleifer and Vishny)- fail in their monitoring efforts but the misconduct is not of sufficient magnitude to make a control change worthwhile. By imposing personal liability on corporate officers and directors for breach of the duties of care (negligence) and loyalty (conflict of interest), litigation is thought to align managers' incentives with shareholders' interests. The efficacy of shareholder litigation as a governance mechanism is hampered by collective action problems because the cost of bringing a lawsuit, while less than the shareholders' aggregate gain, is typically greater than a shareholder-plaintiff's pro rata benefit. To mitigate this difficulty, successful plaintiffs are awarded counsel fees, providing a financial incentive to the plaintiff's attorney to police management.

The objective is to see if the Ethiopian economy can withstand the constraints resulting from surrendering instruments of economic policy in favour of a co-ordinated approach conducted on a regional level in the Horn of Africa. The literature on macroeconomic modelling is reviewed with particular emphasis on its application to the Ethiopian economy where a small modern sector coexists with a large subsistence economy and a significant informal trade and f <nancial sector. The structure of the Ethiopian economy is profiled in terms of the modernization process of pre-1974, the socialist experiment of 1974-91, and the post-1991 free' market reforms. The second part of the thesis focuses on the specification and estimation of a macroeconomic model of the Ethiopian economy. The model is comprehensive, in which the link between the real and financial sectors and the implications of the large informal economy for macroeconomic policy are theoretically argued and empirically tested. The relationship between long-run equilibrium and its short-run dynamics is estimated using the cointegration and the error correction mechanism (ECM) techniques. After examining the goodness-of fit of the macro-model, simulations are carried out to see the effects of policy instruments and exogenous shocks. The results in general suggest that the monetary and fiscal policies of Ethiopia can be effectively conducted under the disciplines of market forces. Interest rate deregulation, where the government bonds are sold at market rates, is less inflationary and serves to raise real income. The maintenance of an artificially overvalued exchange rate and credit rationing that characterized the era of financial repression are shown to have a negative impact on output. Money financing of the budget deficit is highly inflationary while an increase in the premium on the informal exchange rate results in a decline in real output. On the basis of these results policy recommendations are proposed and the use of a similar research methodology is suggested for research on the post-1991 data of Ethiopia and the other potential members of the proposed free-trade area of the Horn of Africa Collapse"
109549,1991,journal of policy analysis and management,measuring the effects of growth controls:  comment,measuring the effects of growth controls comment,"An increasing number of studies, particularly in the area of comparative and historical research, are using the method of agreement and method of difference proposed by Mill (1872) to infer causality based on a small number of cases. This article examines the logic of the assumptions implicit in such studies. For example, the research must assume: (1) a deterninistic approach rather than a probabilistic one, (2) no errors in measurement, (3) the existence of only one cause, and (4) the absence of interaction effects. These assumptions are normally inappropriate, since they contradict a realistic appraisal of most social processes, but are mandatory if wefollow Mill's causal analyses based on small N's. Research should not attempt employment of such methods in smallN cases without a more rigorous justification of heroic assumptions and a guard against possible distortions. This article evaluates a sociological approach that is gaining in usage, especially in researching historical and comparative problems. Namely, we will consider the causal inferences drawn when little more than a handful of nations or organizations sometimes even less are compared with respect to the forces driving a societal outcome, such as a political development or an organizational characteristic.! Application of this method to a small number of cases is not new to sociology, being in one form or another a variant of the method of analytic induction, described by Znaniecki (1934) and analyzed succinctly by Robinson (1951) and Turner (1953).2 The conclusions rely on a formalized internal logic derived from Mill's (1872) method of agreement and his method of difference (see the discussion of Mill in Nichols [1986]). The formal rigor of this type of analysis sets it off from other small-case procedures that also imply causality, i The University of North Carolina Press Social Forces, December 1991, 70(2):307-320 * I am indebted to Williatn Alonso, Rogers Brutbaker, John Campbell, William Kruskal, and Peter V. Marsdenfor stimulating discuissions or comments on this topic. A modified version of this article will be reprinted in What Is a Case, edited by Charles C. Ragin and Howard S. Becker, Cambridge University Press, 1992. Direct correspondence to Stanley Lieberson, Departmnent of Sociology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138. 308 / Social Forces 70:2, December 1991 such as in Street Corner Society (Whyte 1943) or in the development of the urban structure and growth model of Burgess (1925). It is also different from case studies that seek to point out merely that a given phenomenon exists in some setting, as opposed to analyzing its causes. The comments are, however, to some degree relevant in evaluating the Boolean method proposed by Ragin (1987) for dealing with somewhat larger samples used in comparative and historical research. Moreover, although the analysis is stimulated by recent developments in macrohistorical research, it is pertinent to a wide variety of other studies that use Mill's logic with a small number of cases. There are numerous instances of these small-N studies, which apply Mill's methods to infer causality. For example, Moore (1966) uses them in his analysis of the role of various classes and peasantry leading to three different outcomes in seven different nations. Skocpol's (1979) influential study of social revolutions in a small number of countries also uses these methods and attributes their application to de Tocqueville and Bloch. Katznelson (1985) explains ""the puzzle of variation between English and American patterns of working-class formation"" (260) by eliminating any common features shared by the two nations, searching for a distinctive difference that must account for these developments. Likewise, Stepan (1985) employs similarities and differences between Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay to infer relations between 'the power of the state and the power of civil society"" (318). Orloff and Skocpol (1984) compare welfare developments in the U.S. and Britain around the turn of the century, eliminating major conventional theories of welfare-state development because the independent variables are considered the same in both nations. Only one variable is found to differ between the two nations and causal significance is therewith assigned. More generally, we are dealing with any study that attempts to infer the existence or absence of causality through the correlation between the dependent variable and an independent variable across a small number of cases. When the cases differ in outcomes, then it is assumed that the causal variable will have a correlation of ? 1.0 with the dependent variable, with all other correlations having other values. When the cases have the same outcome, then it is assumed that the causal variable will be the same for all cases, with each of the other variables having some variability across cases. Even the classic study by Weber (1930) of the role of the Protestant ethic in the development of capitalism can be used as an illustration of the method of difference. A capitalistic system is observed to develop in only one part of the world. Weber then asks what variable is found in the Protestant West but nowhere else. All other variables, which the countries share, are eliminated as the necessary causal variable. One can readily understand why the logic is appealing despite Mill's (1872) warning that it is inappropriate for social science problems. He specifically illustrates the inapplicability of the method of difference by describing differences between nations, and he observes the weakness of the method of agreement for the typical social science problem as well. As Tilly (1984) observes, the presence of more than one common causal variable makes it impossible for the latter method to sort out the actual cause. We can easily appreciate the goal of making causal inferences based on a small number of cases. If data were available with the appropriate depth and Small N's and Big Conclusions / 309 detail for a large number of cases, obviously the researcher would not be working with these few cases (assuming a minimal time-energy cost). Since the data are not available, or the time-energy cost is too great, one can only approach these efforts with considerable sympathy for their objective. We address three questions: (1) What are the assumptions underlying these studies? (2) Are these assumptions reasonable? (3) What can we do to improve such studies in those instances when they might be appropriate forms of inquiry? However, there is a special difficulty in comprehending the weakness of these applications and the gross assumptions that are necessarily made; namely, the methods are typically applied to topics for which the reader has no experiential grasp. Readers cannot easily see the unreasonableness of a conclusion about macrosocietal events in a distant time and place. To display the nature of this logic, this article draws illustrations from hypothetical applications to automobile accidents and the evaluation of airlines. Probabilistic and Deterministic Perspectives Let us start by distinguishing between causal propositions that are deterministic as contrasted with those that are probabilistic. The former posits that a given factor, when present, will lead to a specified outcome. The latter is more modest in its causal claim, positing that a given factor, when present, will increase the likelihood of a specified outcome. When we say, ""If X1, then Y,"" we are making a deterministic statement. When we say, ""The presence of X1 increases the likelihood or frequency of Y,"" we are making a probabilistic statement. Obviously, if given the choice, deterministic statements are more appealing. They are cleaner, simpler, and more easily disproved than probabilistic ones. One negative case (Y's absence in the presence of X1) would quickly eliminate a deterministic statement. Alas, a probabilistic approach is often necessary to evaluate the evidence for a given theoretical perspective, even if we think in deterministic terms. This occurs for a variety of reasons, not the least being measurement errors a serious problem in the social sciences. The existence of a measurement error means that a given data set may deviate somewhat from a hypothesized pattern without invalidating the hypothesis. In addition to this technical matter, there is an additional problem: complex multivariate causal patterns operate in the social world, such that a given outcome can occur because of the presence of more than one independent variable and, moreover, may not occur at times because the influence of one independent variable is outweighed by other influences working in the opposite direction. Under such circumstances, the influence of X1 is only approximate (even without measurement errors), unless one can consider all the other independent variables, through controls or otherwise. Furthermore, we often do not know or cannot measure all the factors that we think will influence Y. As a consequence, we are again obliged to relinquish a deterministic measurement of the influence of X1 on Y, even if we are prepared to make a deterministic statement about its influence. There are yet other reasons for reverting to a probabilistic rather than a deterministic approach, 310 / Social Forces 70:2, December 1991 namely, the role of chance in affecting outcomes. Beyond consideration here is the question of whether chance per se exists or is simply a residual label referring to our ignorance about additional influences and/or inadequate measures for the variables under scrutiny. In either case, some form or another of indeterminacy is clearly useful to employ in the physical sciences, let alone in the social sciences (see examples in Lieberson [1985:94-97]). Any of these factors would lead to probabilistic statements of outcomes rather than deterministic ones. This distinction is more than merely an academic one. Rather, Collapse"

While expansions and contractions appear to be duration independent, completed cycles seem to be duration dependent. This implies, for example, that a long expansion is no more likely to terminate than a short expansion, whereas the termination probability for a whole cycle depends on its length. As discussed in Diebold and Rudebusch, this perplexing situation is feasible if the lengths of expansions and contractions are negatively correlated. However, they find only weak empirical evidence to support this conjecture. The purpose of this note is to resolve the puzzle by recognizing that it is impossible for expansions, contractions, and completed cycles to all follow the constant-hazard distribution. We then conclude that the (apparent) contradiction arises because the same statistical tests are applied to both half and whole cycles. To illustrate, because data are reported on a monthly basis, we formulate two discrete-time tests for duration dependence. The first of these is applied separately to expansions, contractions, and completed cycles; the second is employed to test jointly the null hypothesis that expansions and contractions are both duration independent. To derive the tests, initially assume that expansions and contractions have constant transition probabilities. If X is the random variable for the number of consecutive months of (say) expansion, p is the (constant) transition probability, and te represents the minimum Collapse"

Recently, several attempts have been made to measure the aggregate costs of rent-seeking activity for the United States. Laband and Sophocleus (1988) present the first published estimates, obtained from a time-series regression of U.S. gross national product on the number of lawyers and bankers in the country. Their estimates imply that rent seeking has reduced aggregate income by 45 percent. Magee, Brock, and Young (1989) perform a cross-country study of the correlation between GNP growth and the ratio of lawyers to physicians. Their results suggest thatJapan is highly prosperous largely because of the relative scarcity of lawyers there. Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1990) regress the rate of growth of GNP between 1970 and 1985 in a number of countries on the fractions of college students majoring in law and in engineering. They obtain results consistent with those of previous work. Laband (1990) abandons reduced-form estimation in favor of a sector-by-sector accounting of direct expenditures on transfer seeking (which includes private-sector transfer activity) in the United States. He estimates that such activity consumed about half of GNP in 1985, a figure that is strikingly close to the reduced-form estimates of Laband and Sophocleus.

109586,1991,journal of public economics,tax evasion and occupational choice,tax evasion and occupational choice,"This paper is concerned with the combined effect of tax compliance and tax audit policy on the occupational choice of individuals and on public policy objectives such as tax revenue, total production, and social welfare. Individuals are assumed to have a choice between riskless work and a risky entrepreneurial occupation. They are only differentiated according to their attitudes towards risk. More risk averse individuals go into the safe occupation and less risk averse people become entrepreneurs. Tax evasion is only accessible to the latter and therefore its control tends to discourage risk taking. Whether control of tax evasion is desirable for the economy as a whole depends on the objective function of the government. It is shown that tax audit policy has conflicting effects on tax revenue, per capita income, and social welfare. These conflicts are illustrated through a numerical example. In this paper, the emphasis is placed on the clarity and the simplicity of the presentation so as to argue that, even though the tax schedule can hardly be differentiated across individuals, tax evasion and its control can be used by policymakers to introduce variability in the individual's tax treatment.

Two of the most important are: (1) the pure statistical model of insurance risk pools, which originates in probability theory and actuarial science; and (3) the financial model of the insurance firm and insurance pricing that draws upon modern financial theory. The two paradigms taken together constitute an important component of the core of the field of risk and insurance or insurance economics. Insurance demand theory and applications of various branches of economics such as industrial organization also are important elements of this core. To a significant extent the existing strands of insurance research have emerged in parallel, and few serious attempts at integration have been carried out. One reason for this is that each area is highly specialized and technical. Insurance-oriented textbooks that successfully bridge the gap between the specialist and a wider audience do not exist. In order for the field of risk and insurance to progress more rapidly, this obstacle must be overcome. The objective of this paper is to take an initial step in that direction by providing an introduction to the central results of two of the principal strands of insurance research: statistical and financial models of insurance pricing and the insurance firm. The next section considers statistical models. In spite of the critical importance of risk pooling in insurance, the statistical foundations of this phenomenon are not well-understood by many insurance experts. Misstatements and fallacies regarding pooling, laws of large numbers, the central limit theorem, and related concepts are pervasive, ranging from principles of insurance courses in the classroom to insurance tax cases in the federal courtroom. This problem exists even though the basic statistical concepts are relatively simple and can be understood and appreciated without a high level of mathematical training. Section I attempts to correct this problem by discussing the implications of the law of large numbers and central limit theorem for insurance risk pooling and by analyzing some of the more persistent insurer's risk fallacies. The discussion then turns to collective risk theory, which provides the most sophisticated statistical model of insurance. This field, which originated primarily in Europe, has experienced some recent advances that significantly increase its potential for practical application. A later section of the paper focuses on financial models of insurance. Financial modelling is one of the most rapidly growing fields of insurance research, particularly on the international scene. The paper provides an introduction to the basic financial applications in insurance. This discussion covers the insurance capital asset pricing model (CAPM), discounted cash flow modeling, and options modeling. Duration, immunization, and asset/liability management also are discussed. The emphasis throughout is on theoretical developments, but the reader should be aware that a growing empirical literature also exists, providing a possible topic for a future review article. Major progress in understanding insurance pricing and insurance markets can be achieved through the integration of the statistical and financial theories of insurance pricing and insurance firms. If this article provides the foundation of knowledge to assist researchers in beginning the integration process, it has accomplished its objective. Statistical Models of Insurance Individual Risk Theory The Model.

109663,1991,land economics,towards an environmental macroeconomics,towards an environmental macroeconomics,"Abstract Material flows induced by national economies can be regarded as indirect pressure indicators for environmental degradation. Economy-wide material flow analysis and indicators have been designed to monitor material and energy flows at the macroeconomic level and to provide indicators, which could contribute to management of resource use and output emission flows from both economic, environmental and broader sustainability points of view. These indicators can serve various purposes including monitoring the material basis of national economies and related environmental pressures, assessment of the material and resource productivity and monitoring the implications of trade and globalisation. The main part of this paper compares the material and resource use of the Czech Republic, Germany and the EU-15 by means of DMI and TMR indicators over the period of 1991–2004 (1991–2000 for EU-15). At the aggregate level both indicators in all three economies do not show any clear decreasing or increasing trends over the period considered. This means that environmental pressure related to use of materials for production and consumption purposes remains rather stable. All the economies however, recorded an increase in the efficiency of transforming the material/resource inputs into economic output. The analysis further revealed that most of the dynamics of DMI and TMR in the Czech Republic tended towards a higher similarity with Germany and the EU-15. In the future, further decreases in DMI as well as in TMR of fossils fuels might be expected in the Czech Republic, which could be counteracted by increase in DMI and TMR of metal ores/metal resources and non-metallic minerals/non-metallic resources. The future development of total DMI, TMR and material/resource intensity in both the Czech Republic and Germany will depend on further shifts to less material intensive industries and services and on increasing material efficiency in production and consumption of particular products. This is not only a technological, but also a social challenge, as there are barriers in current mode of governance and in shaping of current economic and social systems to do so. Collapse"

Over tlle years, however, the benefit levels of these plans have increased significantly, and it is not uncommon for an employee to receive from one and one-half to two times his annual earnings as a death benefit. For the most part, this growth came about largely as a result of competitive employment practices and not as a result of structured planning. There is a growing awareness that the typical earnings-related group life insurance plan is not totally effective in meeting an employer's objective of providing benefits for the surviving dependents of an employee. The purpose of this paper is to review the typical group life insurance plan, the features of various survivor income plans in effect, and the funding and tax considerations of survivor income plans. The majority of employers in the United States provide some form of death benefit for the surviving dependents of an employee. Most commonly, this death benefit is provided by means of group term life insurance (sometimes supplemented by accidental death insurance). An employee may also be entitled to death benefits under his employer's retirement or profit sharing plan. Death benefits are sometimes provided in other forms, such as supplemental cash payments or the use of so-called ""split dollar"" insurance plans. Generally speaking, these death benefits are paid in a lump sum to the beneficiary designated by the employee. Although the option to have the proceeds payable in installments is usually available, it is seldom elected. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in ""survivor"" death benefit plans.

The purpose of this paper is to review the factors that have led to the growth of these ""survivor benefit"" plans, their general features, and the ways in which they can be funded. The tax implications of these benefits are also discussed. Before doing so, however, it is desirable to review the extent to which employer-provided death benefits are now provided in the United States. Employer-Provided Death Benefits The major portion of these death benefits consists of benefits payable under group life insurance policies. At the end of 1968, group life insurance coverage in force in the United States amounted to $438.2 billion, the amount of new group life insurance written during the year 1968, having amounted to $39.4 billion. This group insurance was provided through 73.0 million group life certificates issued under 274,000 master policies. Not Collapse"

109781,1991,public choice,expropriation of foreign direct investments:  empirical evidence and implications for the debt crisis,expropriation of foreign direct investments empirical evidence and implications for the debt crisis,"ConclusionsThe message from the empirical tests is the following. First, we were not able to support the public-interest hypothesis stating that selective expropriations are driven by a national-welfare calculus with costs and benefits directly related to the technological characteristics of foreign firms. Instead, the hypothesis that governments decide on expropriations with regard to their political self-interest seems to be more appropriate. This is true if we look at more widespread expropriations that are unspecific in terms of technological standards (industries). The main factor that drives politically motivated expropriations is the poor overall economic performance of a country, which reinforces earlier findings (e.g., Picht, 1988: 351).Additional regressions were run for selective expropriations that included political-economy variables. The results were as discouraging as the results for the “pure” public-interest calculus. The only explanation of why overall national welfare considerations as expressed by selective rather than unspecific expropriations are not reflected at all in the empirical results we can think of is that either government illusion about its potential or ignorance prevailed. This does not seem to be totally unrealistic (Tullock, 1986: 9–11) in a world where authoritarian governments are dominant with its extreme form being the dictatorship.“The dictator ... has not to worry about the policy outcomes of his decisions, but about their effect on other high officials and on other powers in his government. ... He may in various ways sacrifice the welfare of the state for his own continuance in office” (Tullock 1987: 116, own emphasis). In fact, a look at the list of countries covered by this analysis does not leave any doubts in this respect.Second, these findings suggest also that LDC governments may face difficulties if they try to attract more FDI to compensate for limits encountered with respect to new bank loans. The same reasons that lead creditors to restrict new lending, i.e., poor economic performance (e.g., Nunnenkamp and Picht, 1989; Picht, 1988: 349) may also induce foreign investors to hesitate with new investments. Apparently, firm-specific measures of self-protection (Ehrlich and Becker, 1972) as the use of technologies that increase the cost of expropriation for the host country do not have much impact in realistic settings.Third, LDC governments must build up a reputation that they do not succumb to the political pressures against foreign investors and lenders in case of sluggish economic performance. Otherwise the access to foreign sources of finance, in particular to loans and foreign direct investments, will be restricted just in times of emerging economic difficulties, i.e., when additional foreign financing is most urgently needed. Thus, arrangements that serve as “institutional collaterals” need to be found that specifically address the government's incentive to expropriate and willfully default when the economic performance is poor. Yet it is much more difficult to imagine how such arrangements may look like if the presumption is that one is dealing, more often than not, with non-democratic, ultimately politically unaccountable regimes. The same difficulty, of course, arises with respect to sovereign borrowing, for which FDI might substitute, where patterns of self-enforcing contracts come to bear (Picht, 1990).It is interesting to add, fourth, that external shocks, which may eventually lead to real income losses in the future, initially seem to reduce the likelihood of an expropriation. It is perhaps here were expropriation risks differ systematically from default risks, since some empirical evidence is available that suggests that the risk of willful default increases with external strains (e.g., Nunnenkamp and Picht, 1989; Picht, 1988: 349). The difference might be that the change in the expropriation risk follows with some lag to the initial shock. In other words, the variable measuring the external shock might be taken as a leading indicator with respect to the exposure to expropriation risk.Finally, from all that has been said it may be obvious that the present euphoria with respect to debt-for-equity swaps in LDC financing as a way of converting existing ‘old’ debt into FDIs should be looked at with caution from the sovereign-risk perspective. This aspect has largely been ignored until present.For a recent survey see, for instance, Roberts and Remolona (1987). The reason, of course, is that the international debt crisis was predominantly viewed as either a liquidity or a solvency problem, and not as a matter of government opportunism towards foreign creditors and investors alike.

109782,1991,public choice,"information, special interests, and single-issue voting",information  special interests  and single issue voting,"ConclusionThe purpose of this paper has been to explore some of the implications of single-issue voting. In general terms, single-issue voting has been shown to be a stabilizing influence on majoritarian decision making. In each case examined, stable equilibria exist under single-issue voting. On the other hand, the normative properties of electoral outcomes are less clear cut. Under pure zealotry, electoral equilibria are uniformly Pareto efficient. However, electoral outcomes are not necessarily Pareto optimal in the case of strategic voting by special interest groups. The results suggest that single-issue voting can, by itself, cause electoral outcomes to depart from the center of the distribution of voter ideal points. Special interest groups might, thus, be served in the ordinary course of electoral politics even if they had no recourse to campaign contributions or rent-seeking activities which induce principal-agent problems. Voters who cast their votes as if they were single-issue voters can affect policy at both the largely ignored margins and in the mainstream of policy formation. Voting is enough. Collapse"
109783,1991,public choice,rent-seeking and the behavior of regulators:  an empirical analysis,rent seeking and the behavior of regulators   an empirical analysis,"Summary and conclusionsThe main contribution of this paper is to describe empirically how the rent-seeking process takes place in a regulated industry through the consistency in Board decisions. Evidence provided by discrete-choice decision models of regulators confirms that the conventional rent-seeking view of regulation is correct, namely to distribute wealth between various groups differently from what market forces would do. First of all, the structure of the rent-seeking activities in the Quebec regulated trucking industry is well explained. There exist behavioral uniformities (Russell and Shelton, 1974) in decisions taken by the Quebec Transport Commission, given its wide range of choice provided by the absence of detailed regulatory standards by the Quebec legislature. Secondly, trucking firms and large shippers are the interest groups seeking to extract artificially contrived rents. The capture theory of regulation is not a dominant political strategy and therefore does not analytically explain various trades taking place among interest groups when a permit authority is requested. So logrolling by regulators is clearly essential to maintain their non-transferable investment of time and talent and protect their political afterlife. Thirdly, large firms are more successful, at the margin, than small firms in their expansion because of their political effectiveness. The regulatory agency gives more rents to those who offer relatively strong electoral support to its party. Finally, appointed regulators do not achieve other positive payoffs from the regulatory process than those which may result from the agency problem. So the regulatory agency does not promote its own policy agenda, but rather that of the elected politicians, given the organizational and control problem between these two. Collapse"

Following this line of investigation we extend Hillman and Katz's work to a small numbers case and demonstrate that the degree to which a monopoly rent is dissipated is dependent upon the structure of the risk attitudes of two risk averse individuals.Our earlier laboratory results were evaluated with respect to the risk neutral Cournot-Nash predictions. However, given the uncertainty present in the rent-seeking experiment, our ability to reject these risk neutral predictions may not be, in fact, a failure for the model but a result of risk aversion. In laboratory experiments in which we control for the relative risk attitudes of individual agents, we show that risk aversion matters. The relative risk aversion of individuals affects the level of rent-seeking activity and the extent to which rents are dissipated. In our experiments, the relatively less risk averse individuals dissipated relatively more rent.In future work, it would be instructive to conduct a set of laboratory experiments in which a reliable control for risk neutrality is introduced. This would allow for a more precise test of the risk neutral Cournot-Nash predictions. Collapse"

One interesting question is the extent to which the shape and position of the curve, as distinct from the location on it, is a function of promises. Intuitively, it seems reasonable to assume that there is some relation, but it does not seem plausible to imagine that the curve is only a function of promises. If so, the general result of this paper holds.It is worthwhile noting that an analysis of more elaborate models that include an expanded credibility function and that treat the utility of parties as a function of ideology produce the same results.

109788,1991,public choice,the possibility of a desirable minimal state,the possibility of a desirable minimal state,"Dear Sir I was most interested to read in the June issue of the Journal the latest ICRP Memorandum [1] reporting on the progress made in new thinking since the publication of a proposal for possible changes to the system of protection, put forward by Roger Clarke in 1999 [2]. In going from a population-based to an individual-based philosophy, a number of fundamental issues arise, such as the implications of the abandonment of the concept of collective dose [3]. Clearly, there is some way to go, but here I should like to draw particular attention to the underlying questions concerning dosimetry. In his invited editorial, also published in the June issue [4], although pleading for minimal changes generally (`If it ain't broke, don't fix it'), Geoffrey Webb refers to `sorting out the dosimetry quantities' as `one of the things that need to be done'. Indeed, the ICRP Memorandum itself confirms that this issue `causes concern'. In the Memorandum, mention is made of the `views of metrologists' who, it is stated, have different objectives from those of ICRP. Essentially, metrologists `correctly provided an unequivocal definition of the absorbed dose at a point', which is measurable, whereas ICRP's protection quantities are concerned with the `average tissue dose', which is not. It is stated that in the next recommendations `it will be necessary to clarify the difference' between these two types of quantities. Indeed, the difference between point quantities, including dose equivalent and the operational quantities such as ambient dose equivalent, and mean value quantities such as equivalent dose and effective dose, is discussed in detail in Report 51 of the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements entitled `Quantities and Units in Radiation Protection Dosimetry' [5]. It was on the grounds that in radiation protection `complexity is not justified', and with the laudable aim of simplifying proceedings, that the ICRP introduced the above named mean-value quantities for limiting purposes [6]. However, as these quantities were not subject to `conventional' metrology, and there was still a need for measurement, the ICRP introduced them in parallel with the ICRU point quantities, resulting in the present dual approach. This unsatisfactory situation was compounded by the confusion in terminology, e.g. dose equivalent and equivalent dose. In the ICRP Memorandum [1], mention is made of the possibility of redefining the protection quantities, albeit with `simpler' weighting factors. It should be recalled that it was the introduction by the ICRP in 1991 of simpler radiation weighting factors, applicable to incident beams only irrespective of the size, shape or composition of the medium concerned, which gave rise to some of the present problems. If, as hoped, the `persistent difference of view' between the respective approaches is `to be removed in the next recommendations', it would seem that close cooperation between the two commissions is not only desirable, but essential. The joint objective should be to develop a system of dosimetry which is compatible with the needs of the known biological effects of radiation, hopefully both simpler and meaningful (therein lies the `root of the conflict'), subject to conventional metrology, by the year 2005 as proposed.

109789,1991,public choice,the effect of predatory rent-seeking on household saving and portfolio choices: a cross section analysis,the effect of predatory rent seeking on household saving and portfolio choices  a cross section analysis,"ConclusionsThe existence of predatory behavior, when measured by the number of lawyers per capita and the crime rate, seems to have an impact on saving and investment behavior in U.S. households. Where the risk of redistribution are lowest, the incentives to save are higher and, a fortiriori, the willingness to invest in highly vulnerable financial instruments is enhanced. Either because of low saving rates or because of disintermediation, households in states where the risks of redistribution are greater avoid accumulating financial assets.Recent years have seen a considerable decline in the U.S. saving rate. There is also evidence of large differences in saving rates from one country to another, with U.S. households among the lowest savers. Yet not all of these variations have been explained satisfactorily in empirical studies based on conventional theory. Perhaps one explanation which has been inadequately studied is the reduced expected retirement time horizon whether it be due to objective conditions such as retirement age and life expectancy or to uncertainty. Some reasons for myopic planning horizons are macroeconomic instability (McCauley and Zimer, 1989), the possibility of nuclear war (Slemrod, 1982, 1986 and 1989); Henderschott and Peek, 1985 and 1987); and the fear of socio-political conflict (Stewart and Venieris, 1985). I have suggested and tested here yet another factor: the fear of future redistribution. Using differences in interest income across U.S. states, this paper shows that fear of redistribution does seem to have a large influence on saving behavior. Collapse"

The regression analysis suggested that the political power of the agricultural producers was an important determinant of the policies implemented, especially during times of democratic practices; that during times of military regimes, the agricultural sector tends to be less protected; that there is indirect evidence for the existence of political business cycles synchronized to political elections: and, that general conditions in the economy can influence the behavioral rule of the policy makers.

In order for logrolling to occur there must be clear potential gains from trade, negotiations must be feasible and less costly than the value of the trade, and enforcement must be possible (Buchanan and Tullock, 1962; Mueller, 1979). The city council environment appears to satisfy these requirements. Apart from Zax (1985), however, who examined municipal employment and compensation, no empirical evidence of the effect of logrolling on municipal expenditures levels has been uncovered. Different institutional structures may provide different incentives to trade votes. In particular, ward election systems may provide a greater incentive to logroll than at-large systems (Bradford, 1911; Goetz, 1977). Ward councilors rely on neighborhood loyalties for their re-election. Thus, they are interested in providing public services whose benefits are geographically concentrated but whose costs are spread city-wide. At large councilors, whose constituency is city-wide, are more concerned with city-wide benefits. This difference in loyalties suggests that ward councilors are more apt to engage in vote trading behavior than are at-large councilors. One reason for the lack of empirical evidence of this behavior is that researchers have not examined the appropriate measure of municipal output.

The Great Depression, the research by members of the Stockholm School of Economics' and the work of Keynes quickly led to the view that the ability to forecast the development of key time series in the economy was crucial for stabilization policy. It was Dag Hammarskjold, an influential secretary at the Unemployment Commission in Sweden, who suggested the establishment of the National Institute of Economic Research in 1934. He might have been inspired by a discussion on the issue at the Stockholm Economic Club in 1931, in which Gunnar Myrdal, Bertil Ohlin and Eli F. Heckscher participated. He himself had also written a thesis on the propagation of the business cycle; see Hammarskjold (1933). The National Institute of Economic Research (N.I.E.R.) was founded in 1937 with Erik Lundberg as director. Lundberg had finished his thesis, Studies in the Theory of Economic Expansion, the same year. Although this thesis contained difference equations and theoretical reasoning, Lundberg never liked formalized forecasting techniques. I do not know if he ever read the introductory chapter of Tinbergen's (1937) monograph An Econometric Approach to Business Cycle Problems. If he did, he would probably have disagreed with Tinbergen's statement that ""the purely verbal treatment of these questions leads to a dead end..."". During the decade following the Second World War, the forecasts of the N.I.E.R. were made as ex-ante gap calculations.

The seller of property at higher prices will recirculate that investment into productive sectors, and arguments that the distinction between services and manufacturing is important are erroneous. The 1980s' argument that households are able to release their increased equity gain from house price inflation to finance consumption is the converse of this argument. Rising house prices will require potential buyers to save more in advance of purchase. This paper argues that both lines of reasoning neglect the influence of rising property values on the rate of savings. Rising property prices lead people to believe their wealth to have increased and thus depress their level of savings and increase consumption. This is seen as a particularly British problem because of the impact of land use planning restrictions on land supply, and thus land prices, and the recent shift from rates to the community charge.

During the mid-1980s, a new revolution was heralded in SCs—the shift to so-called application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). According to some, ASICs represent a move from mass production to flexible specialization in SCs. This paper examines international market and technological trends in ASICs, arguing that the main feature of ASICs is a gradual technological decoupling of SC circuit design technology from manufacturing (or fabrication) technology. One of the effects of decoupling is likely to be the emergence of an important independent design sector which serves the downstream users of SCs. With ASIC technology the crucial SC design task is no longer the sole prerogative of the small oligopoly of large international SC manufacturers. For the more dynamic and well-developed newly industrializing countries (NICs), reductions in the barriers to the design and application of SCs may well improve market opportunities in IT industries such as consumer electronics, computing and telecommunications. Failure to acquire SC design capabilities could lead to competitive disadvantage among IT industries in the NICs. The paper provides an analysis of the likely industrial impact of ASICs at the international level and explores possibilities for policy responses within the NICs. Collapse"

In practice, a typical funding agency possesses extremely few levers to improve the performance of an ongoing PE, with perhaps the most potent lever being negotiation over the conditionality for original funding. The present paper suggests a more effective use of such limited levers. We propose that project authorities should be asked and induced to undertake two kinds of pre-commitments at the time of funds approval; a pre-commitment to: (i) link a non-negligible part of the project's employees' compensation to the actual PE performance (we call this the ""profit-sharing pre-commitment""), and (ii) liquidate the project if its ex-post performance falls below some threshold level (we call this the ""liquidation pre-commitment""). Inducements might include making the availability and softness of funding contingent upon such pre-commitments. We discuss three primary sources of PE losses (namely, conventional allocational inefficiencies, X-inefficiencies, and project irreversibility due to ""soft budget constraints""), compare the likely relative magnitudes of associated losses, and argue how incentive pre-commitments would help ameliorate these losses. A simple illustration of the likely large order of magnitude of the ""option"" value of gains from reversibility is also presented. This paper places a central emphasis on pre-commitments because, given the political-economic environment of an LDC, the feasibility of remedial actions is greatly reduced if provisions for such actions have not already been agreed upon in advance--and understood by the parties involved--at the project approval stage. Also, the basic idea of pre-commitments is not in conflict with other approaches for improving PE performance. This paper does not take a position on whether PEs are or are not desirable. Under the premise that PEs are likely to remain important in LDCs in the foreseeable future, our objective is to develop some constructive steps towards improving PE performance. The proposed pre-commitments represent such a step because even though these pre-commitments will not solve all or most of the problems of PEs, and even though the magnitude of the resulting overall benefit would vary across situations, it is difficult to imagine scenarios where such pre-commitments could actually harm PE performance. By contrast, many scenarios can be envisioned where incentive pre-commitments and accountability will improve PE performance. Collapse"

Justifications for use of mediation in these disputes include avoidance of the hostility and psychological costs inherent in litigation and the positive view that disputant-determined agreements are less destructive to family relationships.""

For example, she states that mediation that uses a family systems approach, which she describes as imposing a value-free universe, fails to acknowledge the unequal power that society assigns to men and women and the influence of socialization based on societally-imposed sex roles. 5 9 She argues that mediation can ""deprive a divorcing spouse of the opportunity to appear virtuous in society's eyes and her own.""""w Counseling, not mediation, would be a more appropriate forum for a woman who looks to society for a self-definition of virtue.

Preoccupied with the task of sorting through stacks of resumes, burdened by time-consuming interviews, distracted from the weighty responsibilities of writing opinions and dispensing justice, frustrated by the need to make important staffing decisions on the basis of incomplete information, federal judges complain bitterly to each other about the shortcomings of the selection process and start musing, dreamily, that there must be ""a better way.""

This Comment is dedicated to my family, in appreciation for their support and encouragement, and to my former colleagues in the pharmaceutical industry who remain undaunted by the obstacles. I am grateful to Scott Burris for his comments on earlier drafts of this manuscript. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a communicable and sexually transmitted disease caused by the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV). It is the final phase in a continuum characterized by four distinct disease stages: first, an initial infection which often mimics mononucleosis; second, a period of latent, asymptomatic infection; third, persistent, regionalized lymph node enlargement sometimes called AIDS-related Complex (ARC); and finally, the multiple opportunistic infections, neurological impairments, and other clinical presentations that constitute AIDS. See Centers for Disease Control, U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., Classification System for Human T-Lymphotrophic Virus Type III/LymphadenopathyAssociated Virus Infection, 105 ANNALS INTERNAL MED. 234, 234-35 (1986). The HIV virus is a retrovirus; it uses an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to introduce its genetic material (ribonucleic acid, or RNA) into the genetic material (deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) of a host cell. Initially, the virus is virtually undetectable. Seropositivity (the appearance of viral antibody in the serum) occurs when the altered host cell is properly stimulated by antigens. At that point, the infected host cell's replicatory machinery ""sees"" both the foreign viral material, as well as its own cellular DNA, and thus produces infected cells. Viral proteins are then synthesized and are subsequently packaged together witlh viral genome and released, going on to attack additional cells. HIV has a predilection for particular host cell types, namely, T-helper lymphocytes (also called T-4 cells), macrophages, and monocytes. Since the T-helper lymphocytes are responsible for cell-mediated immunity, their destruction by the virus is a critical cellular event in the development of the disease, causing the immunodeficiency which gives AIDS its name.

Several measures considered to have conceptual merit are disclosed under SFAS 87, but no single method has been deemed most appropriate. The attributes of the three asset and five liability measurement alternatives disclosed and the controversies surrounding the FASB's deliberations on these alternatives are considered in the research design. Because the pension asset and liability issues in SFAS 87 relate to measurement and reflect a variety of unresolved questions, an approach directly comparing measurement error across alternatives is used. The research design utilizes relevance and reliability, two primary accounting choice characteristics advanced by the FASB. These two attributes are operationalized by the variances and levels of differences between alternative measures and the implied investors' assessment. In most prior studies using cross-sectional valuation to address a variety of research questions, a model is posited and then tested by using book values as substitutes for unobservable variables. The measurement error is considered an econometric problem. Although the valuation equation assumed here is also based on unobservable market values, the measurement error is modeled, and the impact of the measurement error Collapse"

Consequently, researchers in accounting and finance have spent considerable effort attempting to measure efficiency. Although this investigation has spanned many research designs and has been applied to many different information signals, empirical tests all suffer from the same basic problem: the benchmark of interest, an informationally efficient market, is unobservable. The asset price that would have prevailed in an efficient market must therefore be modeled, and the test of market efficiency is confounded with a test of the asset-pricing model. Because of this ambiguity, whenever a researcher claims to find an abnormal return based on some information signal another researcher invariably responds that risk was not adequately controlled. For instance, Bernard and Thomas (1989,1990) present evidence that markets do not adequately adjust to quarterly earnings announcements (i.e., there is a significant postannouncement drift), while Ball et al. (1990) argue that the market adjustment may be correct if the level of risk during the announcement period is adequately controlled for. Unlike naturally occurring markets, the efficiency of a laboratory market can be measured directly by creating another ""artificial"" economy that is identical to the economy of interest, except that all information is fully disseminated. The price in the artificial economy is the efficient price by definition; it is determined endogenously and without reference to an Collapse"

Tax advice has two roles in the model and experiment. First, the tax advice allows taxpayers an opportunity to reduce their uncertainty about the amount of taxes owed. This permits us to study the demand for tax advice in conjunction with its effect on tax reporting decisions. Second, the decision to purchase tax advice from an expert provides a means of signaling that may alter tax agency audit policies. The resulting audit policies, in turn, can affect taxpayers' decisions to purchase tax advice. These interdependencies are incorporated in a game-theoretic model and several predictions are tested experimentally. Consistent with theory, subjects sorted themselves into three groups based upon their private information. Another prediction supported by the experiment is that the demand for tax advice increased with the magnitude of an uncertain tax deduction (amount-at-risk). We also found, as expected, that the effects of tax advice on pre-audit tax revenues depend upon the amount-at-risk. When the amount-at-risk was high, subjects in settings with tax advice reported lower average incomes and paid lower taxes than did those subjects in settings without the opportunity to purchase tax advice. The opposite was true for the low amount-at-risk condition, supporting our prediction that tax advice and amount-at-risk would have an interactive effect on tax reporting. Analysis also was performed on post-audit tax collections. Contrary to theory, post-audit tax payments were found to increase when subjects had an opportunity to purchase tax advice. This result apparently was caused by a tendency to over-purchase tax advice and, in some cases, report a low income regardless of the advice received. Collapse"

110113,1991,american economic review,pitfalls in testing for explosive bubbles in asset prices,pitfalls in testing for explosive bubbles in asset prices,"A number of studies (e.g., Robert J. Shiller, 1981; Olivier J. Blanchard and Mark Watson, 1982; Kenneth D. West, 1988) have argued that dividend and stock price data are not consistent with the ""market fundamentals"" hypothesis, in which prices are given by the present discounted values of expected dividends. These results have often been construed as evidence for the existence of bubbles or fads. (Related arguments have been made with respect to gold, bonds, and foreign exchange). A major problem with such arguments (e.g., James Hamilton and Charles Whiteman, 1985) is that apparent evidence for bubbles can be reinterpreted in terms of market fundamentals that are unobserved by the researcher. Behzad T. Diba and Herschel I. Grossman (1984, 1988b) and Hamilton and Whiteman (1985) have recommended the alternative strategy of testing for rational bubbles by investigating the stationarity properties of asset prices and observable fundamentals.1 In essence, the argument for equities is that if stock prices are not more explosive than dividends then it can be concluded that rational bubbles are not present, since they would generate an explosive component to stock prices.2 Using unit-root tests, autocorrelation patterns, and cointegration tests to implement this procedure, Diba and Grossman (1988b p. 529) state that ""the analysis supports the conclusion that stock prices do not contain explosive rational bubbles."" This paper shows that the above battery of tests is in fact unable to detect an important class of rational bubbles. The point is demonstrated by constructing rational bubbles that appear to be stationary when unitroot tests are applied, even though they are explosive in the relevant sense. Simulations show that, when such bubbles are present, stock prices will not appear to be more explosive than dividends on the basis of these tests, even though the bubbles are substantial in magnitude and volatility. The presence of rational bubbles in actual stock prices thus remains an open question. Collapse"

If that is true, then long-run movements in prices and labor costs must be correlated. If long-run movements in a time series are modeled as a stochastic trend, then the above noted implication of the 'price markup' view is related to the concept of cointegration discussed in Granger (1986), which says that cointegrated multiple time series share common stochastic trends. The evidence reported here shows that time series measuring rates of change in prices and labor costs are cointegrated. Furthermore, this cointegration appears consistent with Granger-causality running from the rate of change in prices to the rate of change in labor costs, but not vice versa as suggested by the 'price markup' view.

110117,1991,american economic review,a test of tariff endogeneity in the united states,a test of tariff endogeneity in the united states,"The high level of protection that exists in many countries is a source of irritation to the normative biases that most economists hold in favor of liberal trade policies. Public-choice explanations of protection, however, suggest that interest groups vie in the political system for self-serving policies, including tariffs and other forms of protection. Such an approach explains the existence of policies that do not seem to be in the ""national interest"" of aggregate economic efficiency. This paper examines aggregate time-series data for the United States from 1890 to 1970 in order to test some of the hypotheses that arise from this public-choice approach. Specifically, Granger-causality tests are carried out over a set of international and macroeconomic variables for the 1890-1970 period. A vector autoregressive (VAR) methodology is employed to examine the data for several reasons. First, theories of tariff endogeneity suggest that tariffs are created and changed in the political system in response to certain economic factors. However, the standard theory of tariffs suggests that feedback effects exist from tariffs to many of the same economic factors: for instance, the price level, income, unemployment, and the trade balance. Therefore, a structural regression model with causality preestablished may be misspecified. Furthermore, the political process is slow to respond to pressure in some cases. This implies that an uncertain lag structure lies behind the relationship among time-series variables. Using a VAR model allows flexibility in selecting a lag structure. A VAR model is also useful for eliminating secular changes in variables.' Consequently, we expect to establish a set of causal relationships through the VAR methodology. Collapse"

The overlapping-generations life-cycle model developed by Lawrence Summers (1981) cannot easily be used to answer this question. Because individuals of different ages alive at the time of the tax substitution differ in their shares of income, consumption, wages, and savings propensities, steady-state welfare changes include redistribution of taxes and factor incomes. The effects of redistribution on the calculation can be controlled for by tracing the transition. In another paper, Summers (1980) used myopic expectations (individuals assume that current prices will prevail) and solved the economy's equilibrium for 100 years. Gains and losses were discounted and summed. Alan Auerbach, Laurence Kotlikoff, and Jonathan Skinner (1983), hereafter referred to as AKS, employed a perfect-foresight model. They used lumpsum payments to keep the utility of those alive at the time of the tax change fixed and allowed equal equivalent variations to all future generations.1 A perfect-foresight model requires simultaneous solution of many years of equilibria (150 years in the AKS model). Although these techniques eliminate distributional elements, such models are so costly to construct, modify, and use that the study of relative efficiency of alternative tax regimes is now greatly hampered by computational complexity. This study has two major contributions. First, it introduces a much simpler method of separating the efficiency and redistributional components of steady-state gains. Rather than tracing the transition, it uses a system of transfers which ensures that changes in welfare in the steady state do not arise from redistribution of income to or from transitional generations. While this approach does not allow calculation of the transition, its application to the AKS model suggests that very little information about the magnitude of efficiency effects is lost by forgoing the tracing of the transition. For estimating the relative efficiency of income, consumption, and wage taxation, or the extent to which assumptions drive the results, this approach greatly simplifies the researcher's task.2 This simplification becomes increasingly valuable as more detail is introduced into models, which could involve thousands of equations using an approach that traces the transition. Secondly, my calculations suggest that switching tax bases may not be worthwhile. This result differs from the results of Summers (1981) and Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987), which strongly suggest that the consumption tax is always superior on efficiency grounds.

110122,1991,american economic review,does poor supervisability undermine teamwork?  evidence from an unexpected source,does poor supervisability undermine teamwork evidence from an unexpected source,"A central problem with the organization of team production is that, if individual effort contributions are difficult to observe, feasible schemes for distributing the net product among participants may suffer from poor work incentives. Thus, Armen Alchian and Harold Demsetz (1972) argue that efficiency commonly requires that there be an agent who monitors and disciplines other team members in exchange for the right to retain team residual earnings, while Bengt Holmstrom (1982) shows that monitoring may in some cases be dispensed with, provided that there is a ""budget-breaking"" principal to perform an analogous disciplinary function. These arguments imply that production in residual-sharing cooperative teams will be beset by free-riding problems occasioned by inadequate reward discrimination due to the absence either of monitoring incentives or of an agent with effective disciplinary powers. Such disadvantages are thought to be multiplied in agricultural cooperatives, because farm production is considered especially difficult to monitor (Michael Bradley and M. Gardner Clark, 1972; Joseph Stiglitz, 1974; Hans Binswanger and Mark Rosenzweig, 1986) and because scale economies, especially in labor-intensive systems, appear to be negligible (Putterman, 1989). The fact that restoration of householdbased farming in China during the early 1980's led to a pronounced increase in output and productivity has been viewed as evidence in support of this thesis. To be sure, the degree to which the gains recorded during 1978-1984 reflected changes in farm-level organization as opposed to being a result of policy changes in such areas as crop specialization, pricing, and opening of free markets, remains a matter of some uncertainty (Dwight Perkins, 1988). A more subtle question, however, is that of the extent to which any gains due to micro organizational change should be attributed to supervision problems of the type mentioned above. A recent contribution by John McMillan, John Whalley, and Lijing Zhu (1989; hereafter MWZ), which attempts to answer the first of these questions, gives rise to surprising implications regarding the second. MWZ combine a simple model of incentives and utility maximization with standard growth-accounting techniques to reach the conclusion that 78 percent of the increase in agricultural productivity in China during the period in question can be attributed to nonprice factors, principally ""the incentive effects of the new responsibility system"" (p. 782). Their model and estimates also imply that Chinese peasants supplied only a little over half (56 percent) as much effort under the communal system as under the succeeding household-based farming system and that this is attributable to the fact that peasants expected to receive only about 30 percent of the value product generated by incremental effort. Questions might be raised regarding the study's methodology and, hence, the numbers derived. The aim of the present note, however, is to point out that, if the findings of MWZ are to be believed, then although China's collective farms did indeed suffer from inadequate incentives, it may be wrong to attribute much of this to deficiencies in supervision. The MWZ model is not sufficiently microanalytic to distinguish between monitoring problems and other possible dampeners *Department of Economics, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912.

110124,1991,american economic review,horizontal mergers: reply,horizontal mergers reply,"Consider an industry composed of N firms in a symmetric equilibrium. Designate a subset of S (< N) firms and marginally reduce the strategic variables of the firms in the subset. If the remaining firms simultaneously make the best reply to this exogenous displacement, under what circumstances will profits of the firms in the designated subset increase? We show that, in the case of Cournot competition among producers of perfect substitutes, a marginal contraction is strictly beneficial (strictly harmful) if and only if the number of firms in the designated subset exceeds the ""adjusted"" number of firms outside it by strictly more (strictly less) than one. The adjustment factor is unity when cost and demand functions are linear but, more generally, depends on the convexity of the cost and demand curves. Thus, a marginal contraction of two firms in a triopoly has no effect on the profits of firms in the subset if cost and demand functions are linear; if instead cost is linear but the inverse demand function is strictly concave (strictly convex), a marginal contraction will strictly decrease (strictly increase) profits. The analysis is extended to the effects of nonmarginal exogenous changes in the outputs of the constrained firms. This extension has implications for the relationship of Stackelberg (sequential move) and Nash (simultaneous move) equilibria. Our analysis has broad application. To illustrate, we show that it unifies results in the literature on export subsidies, horizontal mergers, and strikes. The paper is organized as follows. In Section I, our comparative-static result is derived. In Section II, we present a wide range of applications.

Most of these inventions are granted patent protection, and many inventors obtain patent protection in more than one country for their inventions. Publicly supported agricultural R&D, including research done in the U.S. Department of Agriculture-State Agricultural Experiment Station (USDA-SAES) system, also produces inventions intended for use by farmers, but few of these inventions are granted patent protection.2 A recently completed research project conducted at Yale University provides procedures for assigning patented inventions to ""Industries of Use"" (IOUs) including agricultural production industries.3 Specifically, the project developed a ""concordance"" mapping inventions classified by International Patent Class (IPC) into industries classified by Standard Industrial Class (SIC). The concordance can be applied to international patent data sets reporting IPCs and thus provides estimates of inventions by IOU (or by Industries of Manufacture, IOM) by country of origin.4 This paper reports estimates of inventions intended for use in U.S. agricultural production sectors as well as in the input supply and agricultural service sectors.

110166,1991,american journal of agricultural economics,international technology transfer: private channels and public welfare,international technology transfer private channels and public welfare,"The economics of technology transfer is receiving increasing attention as economists acknowledge the role of transfer on future technological innovation, income, and growth. In agricultural economics, much research has focused on improving the international structure of intellectual property to facilitate technology creation and transfer or on analyzing the impacts of new technology, including that acquired from foreign sources, on productivity growth and welfare (Centner and White; Cochrane; Edwards and Freebairn; Alston, Edwards, and Freebairn). In general, this body of research is either not concerned with how technology is transferred or assumes the existence of a poorly defined technology market. But the specific channels of technology transfer are important in many sectors in the economy. In agriculture, the increasing importance of the private sector in the creation and transfer of technology suggests a closer examination of the channels of transfer.' These channels include direct exports of goods that embody technology, foreign direct investment, technology licenses, and joint ventures. They can strongly affect the quantity of technology transferred, the distribution of gains to the agents involved, and any additional innovation in the importing country stimulated by the acquisition of the new technology (Cheng, Pugel). In addition, policies that either affect transfer directly (patent rights, licensing regulations) or indirectly (trade policies, industrial policy) can have a significant impact on the willingness of private companies to trade in technology. In typical transfers of technology, for example between input sectors, the technology supplier may be able to structure the contract for the transaction to increase the benefits received. Collapse"
110170,1991,american journal of agricultural economics,the effect of the 1990 farm bill on agricultural trade,the effect of the 1990 farm bill on agricultural trade,"A struggle has taken place across the Atlantic between the pocketbooks of the U.S. federal government and the European Economic Community during the 1980s. The battlegrounds have been importing countries that have received heavily subsidized exports of agricultural goods from the two big producers. The casualties are competing exporters and those, often third world countries, who would produce and perhaps even export agricultural products in an undistorted world market. Two major policy events during 1990 threatened to alter the weapons and fortunes in this trans-Atlantic struggle: reauthorization of the five-year U.S. farm legislation and the global trade negotiations under the GATT. This paper reviews briefly the status of these two events and summarizes expected trade impacts. Both events promised to address long-standing imbalances in agricultural markets. The combination of policies in the United States and EC, increases in farm yields, and saturation of domestic markets had led to recurring conditions of excess capacity, turbulent farm sector economies, and competition for international markets. These trends began with policy changes in the early 1970s that contributed to huge government outlays as the 1980s progressed. Pressure to alter the policy course became severe in the United States as government support for agriculture soared and high loan rates in the 1981 Farm Act curtailed U.S. markets overseas. Collapse"

Assessing the performance of this sector after the introduction of these policies can help to evaluate the real impact of the reforms on agricultural productivity and to design future policy reforms or take corrective measures. In this paper we employ the stochastic frontier production function to examine technical, allocative and economic efficiency in crop production using farm level data from 1993/94 and 2000/01 production years in post-reform Ethiopia. In addition, we decompose the growth in agricultural production to examine the contributions of the changes in efficiency, technology and inputs to the total factor productivity (TFP) in agriculture. Results show that there are inefficiencies attributable to household and farm characteristics and the policy environment. There was a decline in TFP, allocative and economic efficiency during the period resulting in poor performance of the sub-sector and indicating an adverse impact of the reform. There was no significant change in technical efficiency. Collapse"

New and improved data are needed to assess risks, consumer demand, and costs of alternative private and public control strategies. Food safety data were identified as a high priority by several groups. The 1989 Survey of Agricultural and Rural Social Scientists ranked ""very important"" data collection and dissemination efforts and gave ""develop measures of food safety"" a rank of seventh and ""inventory of pesticide and herbicide applications"" a rank of ninth (Hushak, Chern, and Tweeten). A report of the planning and budget subcommittee of the Experiment Station Committee on Organization and Policy (ESCOP), Research Agenda for the 1990s: A Strategic Plan for the State Agricultural Experiment Stations, rated ""ensuring the safety and stability of consumer foods"" as its first priority. The National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) added food safety to its list of program areas for funding in 1990, largely because of ESCOP's rating. President Bush proposed a major food safety initiative in 1989 with a large data collection component, and Congress appropriated funds in 1990. Better data are needed on the incidence, severity, and economic dimensions of foodborne disease from microbial (bacteria, parasites, fungi, and viruses), chemical (insecticides, herbicides, fertilizers, animal drugs, environmental contaminants, food additives), and natural constituents (including biotechnology) in food.' No data source exists with definitive estimates of the number of illnesses caused by foodborne sources or the distribution of disease severities (OMB). The estimates in the literature suggest that microbial sources are causing from 6.5 to 33 million cases of foodborne disease annually and 9,000 deaths (Bennett et al., Garthright, Archer, and Kvenberg). Chemical sources of foodborne disease risk are less well characterized. A worst case EPA estimate suggests 6,000 cases of cancer annually (EPA 1987), while others have reckoned the risk to be much smaller (EPA 1990, Ames and Gold, Archibald and Winter). Economists can contribute to the food safety discussion by identifying data needed for economic analysis, estimating the social welfare costs of foodborne illness, and estimating benefits and costs of alternative control programs.

110182,1991,american journal of agricultural economics,international capital markets and interest groups,international capital markets and interest groups,"Capital market integration has increased the scale and mobility of capital movements within and among nations to unprecedented levels. Integration is fairly recent. Frankel concludes from his review of the literature that barriers in the major world financial markets were sufficiently low that by 1989, financial markets could be viewed as being fully integrated.' The scale and mobility of capital flows among nations has numerous implications to currency values, interest rates, wealth, and, through current capital account linkages, to relative product and factor prices. Capital flows that have real economic effects also affect the functioning of policy instruments and how effective they are in remunerating an interest group at the expense, if any, of others. This paper provides insights into the process and linkages by which the integration of capital markets has altered economic policy through interest group pressures on government. If economic policy is viewed as the outcome of interest groups seeking through the power of the state that which cannot be provided by the market alone, then capital market adjustments that affect the return to policy instruments can also affect the returns to lobbying resources and, hence, the balance of political influence among the various groups.2 This type of explanation for economic policy has been forwarded under the rubric of models of ""rent seeking"" (Krueger 1974).3 The paper is organized as follows.4 Selected historical evidence linking capital markets to pressures for legislation in the United States and other countries is briefly reviewed. In some cases, capital market adjustments have eased pressures for protection, while, in other cases, adjustments either forced policy change because of a liquidity constraint or made unprofitable the lobbying for sustaining policy in face of these adjustments. The discussion in the next section provides deeper insight into capital market-lobbying linkages. Discussion focuses on the results from a simple model of rent seeking, where government intervenes in markets and provides sector-specific public goods. Collapse"

It underlines how the debt crisis has severely curtailed the previously increasingly important net flows of private capital to developing countries.

Results for two previous studies on this deficit-interest rate relationship are re-estimated using these measures of expected inflation and the interest rate variables. Additional results reported in this paper further indicate that empirical estimates of the interest rate effects of budget deficits are sensitive to the choice of the expected inflation variable. In addition to the choice of the inflation variable, a number of other robustness tests are included.

110235,1991,applied economics,an empirical analysis of occupational expectations,an empirical analysis of occupational expectations,"Abstract The present study examines the application of Resource Dependence Theory and Institutional Theory relative to company involvement in an important voluntary, governmentally sanctioned employee safety program that goes by the acronym VPP Utilizing this combined theory approach, the study empirically demonstrates, through a design incorporating correlation and multiple regression analysis, that Institutional Theory is useful for predicting program prevalence within a given industry, though Resource Dependence Theory complements the former by offering an accounting of strategic firm behavior. Companies consider adoption of beyond compliance safety programs as a strategy to manage the expression of resource control power on the part of powerful stakeholders, while Institutional Theory helps to explain the mechanisms by which such programs proliferate through a given institutional field. Introduction The present study explores the efficacy of Resource Dependence Theory (RDT) and Institutional Theory (IT) as a theoretical foundation for understanding why organizations participate in beyond compliance safety and health programs. These two theories have frequently been used in concert in various attempts to explain organizational phenomena (Lucas, Avi-Itzhak, Robinson & Morris, 2005; Peng, 2004) due, in part, to the shortcomings in each of the two perspectives that the other is capable of satisfying. Institutional theory, for instance, has been criticized in the past for focusing primarily on organizational adaptations resulting from institutional pressures including social values, norms and expectations imposed by the external environment without a great deal of consideration given to the influence of active agency and external exchange relationships that play a part in driving organizational change (Oliver, 1991; Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978; Abernethy & Fong, 1996). RDT, on the other hand, complements Institutional Theory in that active agency is essentially a fundamental tenet of the theory which also focuses specifically on exchange relationships with the external environment as they relate to resource inter dependence between the firm and various stakeholder groups (Oliver, 1991; Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). The present paper considers the marriage of these two theoretical perspectives as they relate to the emergence and growth of beyond compliance safety and health (SH Manuele, 2003). The intent behind VPP, therefore, is to provide recognition to employers that successfully protect their employees from workplace injuries and illnesses through the utilization of sophisticated management systems. Thus, consideration for the employee stakeholder group weighs heavy in the decision to participate in VPP. However, participation also impacts the perception of the firm by other stakeholders having power to control resources important for firm survival. These include not only employees, but also the government, local community, customers, suppliers and other important stakeholder groups as well. Likewise, VPP has become a recognized, legitimate socially responsible endeavor and has proliferated within a number of industries. … Collapse"

One of the enduring characteristics of the Canadian labour market has been substantial and peresistent unemployment rate disparities across provinces.

Specifically, smaller firms tend to offer more unstable employment prospects and will tend to attract workers who are themselves unstable. As demonstrated by empirical analysis, the risk of permanent employment separation (i.e. the risk of firm failure) is in fact negatively correlated with firm size. Moreover, when this measure of employment risk is included as a determinant of wages, the independent influence of firm size on wages vanishes. These results suggest that firm size merely proxies for the risk of firm failure by capturing unobservable sources of heterogeneity in workers and firms. Collapse"

It is argued that such models, expressed in terms of stochastic differential equations, are more realistic in representing the dynamic evolution of many economic time series, particularly at the aggregate level. However, such models impose complicated restrictions on the discretely observed data, which must be taken account of in estimation. The appropriate methodology is applied to a version of the consumption function for UK data, and is found to provide a good description of the data. The estimated continuous time model is compared with more popular discrete models, and is found to provide superior dynamic post-sample predictions over 16 quarters.

Imports and exports exhibit similar response patterns to unexpected changes in relative prices and exchange rates.

The hypothesis is that early closing hours are a low cost institutional response to net social costs that can arise when time is used competitively to redistribute customers spatially. Competition produces this result when stores's marginal customers value longer shopping hours more highly than the average customer. Evidence is presented on the characteristics of 45 Ontario cities that had the choice of whether or not to adopt early closing hours and logit analysis is used to test the model's predictions.

Cyprus is an example of a country which does not have a sophisticated financial sector and which faced a severe political shock at a certain point in her history. The hypothesis of instability in the demand for money function cannot be rejected if the effects of this shock are not taken into account. In particular, it is argued that there was a once and for all increase in the income elasticity of this function at the time of the shcock. When this shift is accounted for by the introduction of an appropriate variable in the cointegrating regression the hypothesis of instability in the demand for money is rejected. Two dynamic error correction models are then specified with income and consumption as the scale variables respectively. Non-nested tests are carried out which reveal that consumers' expenditure is a more appropriate scale variable than GDP. Collapse"

For Europe, however, several observers have suggested that tighter regulatory impediments to the recruitment and dismissal of employees are responsible for temporary layoff unemployment being virtually non-existent. Against this background this paper uses administrative data to evaluate the quantitative importance of temporary separations among the unemployed in Austria and to track its composition by industries. The main finding of our empirical analysis is that about one-third of all unemployment spells in Austria in 1985 ended with the individual returning to the former employer. Since temporary layoff unemployment was found to be on average of shoter duration, it comprised a somewhat lower fraction of total weeks of unemployment. However, temporary layoff unemployment thus accounts for the same proportion of unemployment in Austria as in the US or Canada. Collapse"

The fraction of the national income that is devoted to health care provision increases with the per capita income regardless of whether health care is measured in terms of expenditure or quantity. The relative price of health care has a rationing effect on the quantity of health care that is offered, with a price alasticity close to minus one.

The result is a pattern of cross-subsidization to those firms that generate considerable layoffs from those firms that exhibit a stable pattern of employment. Past studies have investigated this cross-subsidization by industries, but have not examined in detail whether or not the characteristics of the firm play an important role. The research presented herein examines the relationship between particular characteristics of the firm – age, size, average wage, and seasonality of employment – and their effect on whether the firm is subsidized or not. Other than the industry classification, age appears to be the most significant determinant of subsidization. It appears that both young and old firms display a higher probability of subsidizing middle-age firms. Collapse"

As a result, there is marked heterogeneity in assessment and categorization of beverage intake across studies. The purpose of this article is to critically review beverage categorization in recent (published since 2010) observational studies that evaluated beverage intake in relation to weight/adiposity in US youth, and to put forth an initial proposal for a standardized beverage classification system. Standardized beverage classification is critical to ensure transparency in nutrition science research and facilitate comparison of findings across studies. A systematic literature search identified 37 eligible studies, across which beverage categorization varied considerably. The most heterogeneity was observed for categorization of ""sugar-sweetened beverages"" and the greatest consistency was observed for categorization of 100% juices. This review provides an evidence-based starting point for urgently needed, collaborative work to determine priorities for beverage categorization and leverage existing standards of identity in order to create and disseminate a standardized beverage classification system. A standardized approach will inform meaningful assessment of beverage consumption in research studies and facilitate impactful translation of research findings into public health nutrition policy.

110281,1991,applied economics,government spending and the exchange rate,government spending and the exchange rate,"Still another year of tepid R&D spending growth is in store for the United States, DRI/McGraw-Hill predicts. The Lexington, Massachusetts economics consulting firm expects total R&D spending to reach $157.9 billion next year. That's $5.6 billion more than DRI anticipates for 1991 and only 0.7 percent above the expected 3 percent inflation rate. In constant 1982 dollars, the 1992 forecast is only a shade above 1988 R&D spending ($112.53 billion vs. $110.2 billion). U.S. industry's share of 1992 spending is predicted to be $80.9 billion, an 8 percent increase over 1990 but only 1.6 percent more when inflation is factored in. Michael Montgomery, a senior associate at DRI/McGraw-Hill, blames budget pressure on government and non-profits for ""extraordinarily small"" growth in total R&D spending in 1989 and 1990. In 1989, the increase (in constant dollars) over 1988 was 0.9 percent, while 1990 actually showed a 0.5 percent drop. Non-industrial R&D declined approximately 1 percent in each of those years and will show only a minor upturn in 1991 and 1992, Montgomery says. ""If the U.S. military is not looking to fight high tech wars with the Soviet Union and expects the most likely engagements to be with powers on the technical expertise level of the Iraqis, then they don't need to spend as much,"" he observes. As for industry, it faces a recovery from the recession that Montgomery calls anemic by historical standards. He notes that the economy usually grows by 5 percent in the first year of a recovery. With a weaker recovery in progress, however, the profits to fuel a big R&D spending increase just aren't there, he says. Some Wlll Spend More R&D growth in certain industries will out-pace inflation next year, according to Schonfeld & Associates. The Evanston, Illinois management consulting firm and publisher of the annual R&D Ratios and Budgets predicts, for example, that the R&D budgets of semiconductor makers will increase 7.3 percent, while most segments of the computer industry will grow between 6.5 and 15 percent (see table, next page). Of the top 20 R&D spenders, only 10 are headquartered in the U.S., the 1991 R&D Ratios and Rudgets reveals. Once again, General Motors is forecast to be the biggest investor in R&D, with a 1992 R&D budget of $6.090 billion. IBM will be close behind, with $5.788 billion, up 8.5 percent from 1991, compared to 4 percent for third-place NEC and 5.3 percent for fifth-place Hitatchi. Digital Equipment will spend 10.6 percent more in 1992, Hewlett-Packard 11.1 percent and Apple 17.7 percent. In chemicals, Schonfeld expects Dow Chemical to boost its R&D budgct 11.7 percent, compared to 6.7 percent at Imperial Chemical. In pharmaceuticals, Bristol Myers Squibb will increase R&D spending by 21.6 percent, faster than many foreign firms, including Glaxo and Wellcome but not enough to surpass Smith Kline Beecham at 24.3 percent. Only AT&T among the top 20 U.S. R&D spenders is projected to show no growth in R&D, with its $2.4 billion budget 0.7 percent less than 1991's. (AT&T does show growth when NCR's $594 million R&D budget is included.) Schonfeld expects most of the growth in the computer industry to be from software, with R&D spending exceeding $2 billion for the first time. The firm's forecasts are drawn from a database of more than 2700 publicly owned companies, relying on data compiled from Form 10-K reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission and a proprietary econometric model. The model combines individual firms' historical R&D spending patterns with the major R&D drivers, which include gross profits and sales. President Eugene P.

Our key findings are as follows. (1) Complete derecognition of unions in a firm was rare even in firms with low trade union density. (2) Partial derecognition in multi-plant firms was more common. Some 13 per cent of companies with recognized unions in 1984 had had at least partial derecognition by 1990. (3) Large falls in trade union density within a firm have also been rare, though small but observable declines have been commonplace. (4) The coverage of the closed shop has substantially declined, and this decline has been most marked in the last five years. Around one-quarter of firms with recognized unions in 1990, however, still had closed-shop arrangement for at least part of their work-force. (5) There has been no clear decline in the prevalence of multi-unionism or multiple bargaining units. (6) There has been a significant move away from national/industry-wide bargaining, towards negotiations at the individual company or more often the establishment level. (7) In the absence of collective bargaining there have been clear moves away from wage-setting by formal external links, such as wages councils and multi-employer agreements, and even away from worker consultation towards more managerial discretion.

Much of General Motors' and Ford's recent profits have come from European operations that in some cases are protected from competition with Japanese automobile manufacturers by import barriers-a luxury that will end soon because the Japanese are building plants in Europe. Independently, Europe may lower its barriers. Japanese production capacity also continues to grow in America. By the mid1990s Japanese transplants will be capable of producing 3.5 million cars and light trucks a year, nearly 25 percent of all current U.S. sales. While the Japanese are building plants, American companies are closing them-eight in the past three years. The Japanese product line is also growing, with cars produced in all size classes, including luxury and midsize, the traditional strongholds of U. S. producers. American companies must also confront the end of the long U. S. economic expansion. The most concrete indication of the industry's decline is the change in U.S. market share during the past decade. As shown in figure 1, the Japanese firms increased their share by 10 percentage points despite being constrained by quotas (voluntary restraint agreements), by a 40 percent appreciation of their currency, and by a difficult transition to American-based production.

110500,1991,canadian journal of economics,some implications of variable returns to scale: the case of industry-specific factors,some implications of variable returns to scale  the case of industry specific factors,"In Herberg and Kemp (1969) it was shown that if joint production is ruled out, if each production function is homothetic and if some additional, more technical requirements are met, then in a neighbourhood of zero output for any commodity the production frontier is strictly convex (concave) to the origin if and only if that commodity is subject to locally increasing (decreasing) returns to scale. The proposition has been found interesting, especially by trade theorists, because of the mildness of the restrictions imposed on production functions. Recently, however, Professors Markusen and Melvin (1984, 32) have suggested that the scope of the proposition is more circumscribed than had been thought. In particular, they have claimed that the proposition relies on the indispensability of each factor in each industry and therefore is inapplicable in a context of industry-specific factors. To that suggestion we now offer a brief reply, in the course of which we emphasize points that were merely implicit in our 1969 exposition. We begin with the observation that, properly understood, the 1969 proposition already accommodates any realistic blend of mobile and specific factors. In the formal statement of the proposition there are two or more named factors of production. All named factors are efficiently allocated to two or more industries; that is, they are mobile factors. However, in the background, helping to determine the form of the production functions, there can be any number of anonymous specific factors. Moreover, some of the specific factors may be found only in a proper subset of industries. Nor does the proposition rely on the indispensability of factors. In the 1969 proof it was assumed that marginal rates of factor substitution have the same range in each industry. However, that assumption does not imply indispensability; it is quite compatible with isoquants that reach the axes, as in the case of CES production functions with elasticities of substitution greater than one.

An argument is made that the more relevant debate is between qualitative and quantitative approaches to counseling research. Some of the differences between the two approaches, as they relate to Strong's ideas, are presented. A proposal is set forth stating that until a more accurate account of events in counseling is achieved, research that is driven by formal theory is of no greater scientific value than less theoretical approaches. Strong (1991) has constructed an interesting argument in favor of theory-driven research in counseling. At the same time, he has contrasted theory-driven research with what he refers to as naive empiricism. The latter is equated, in Strong's view, with alternative (Hoshmand, 1989) or qualitative approaches to research. Although we agree with much of what Strong has to say, we believe that the parallel he draws between naive empiricism and alternative methods is misleading. Theory-driven methods are not exclusively quantitative, nor are empirical methods exclusively qualitative. We believe that progress in advancing scientific knowledge of counseling, however that is achieved, will occur more rapidly when counseling psychologists obtain a correct understanding of the basic facts of counseling. Therefore, the critical problem facing counseling researchers is finding scientific paradigms that are suitable for studying counseling phenomena. Questions about Collapse"

The central bank also imposes an indicative target, which may not be binding at all times, for total credit in the banking system. We develop and calibrate a theoretical model to illustrate the conduct of monetary policy within the framework of dual-track interest rates and a juxtaposition of price- and quantity-based policy instruments. We model the transmission of monetary policy instruments to market interest rates, which, together with the quantitative credit target in the banking system, ultimately are the means by which monetary policy affects the real economy. The model shows that market interest rates are most sensitive to changes in the benchmark deposit interest rates, significantly responsive to changes in the reserve requirements, but not particularly reactive to open market operations. These theoretical results are verified and supported by both linear and GARCH models using daily money and bond market data. Overall, the findings of this study help us to understand why the central bank conducts monetary policy in China the way it does, using a combination of price and quantitative instruments with differing degrees of potency in terms of their influence on the cost of credit.

The main goal of every investor is, thus, to launch their investment in order to get a maximum profit from the output of their investment. To encourage the investors to invest in the financial assets, these sorts of assets must be greater than the other options (Mehrani & Bahramfar, 2004). The implementation of efficient market economy theory, which has received considerable attention by governors in the recent years, has been able to partially increase the capital market's share of money in financing firms. In effect, the qualitative and quantitative development of the capital market and the Islamic financial affairs as the main sources of financing in the last two decades, the formulation of the accounting and auditing standards required for the economic entities and other corrective actions have turned the exchange markets to one of the best options for the investment. According to the latest statistics, more than ten million Iranians are investing part of their resources in the exchange market. Therefore, this study was intended to investigate the effect of financial sustainability on monetary policy transfer mechanisms. In effect, the correlation between investor confidence in the markets, money growth and macroeconomic growth without oil was, indeed, analyzed along with their fluctuations. 1 Professor, Faculty of Social Sciences and Economics, Alzahra University, Tehran, Iran. 2 Assistant Professor of Tolou-e-Mehr Non-Profit Institute of Higher Education, Qom, Iran.

The stock price index is, indeed, the most important factor influencing investor decision making in the stock market; therefore, we need to be aware of the factors influencing stock prices. The process of monetary policy transfer begins from the asset market because the cost of information and transaction for the most assets are lower than the costs of changing the production or adjusting the consumption or investment of durable goods, especially when there is uncertainty about policies whether they are permanent or temporary. As the asset market responds very quickly, therefore assets prices play an important role in the money transfer mechanism. Using the MGARCH estimator, this study investigated the relationship between investors' confidence ratios, real money growth, and economic activity without crude oil exports and their fluctuations. Using this estimator enables the estimation of uncertainties so as to achieve perfectly consistent criteria. In this study, the PEG index of price-earnings to earnings growth for a variable of investor confidence, which is a better indicator than PE, was calculated. It should be considered that the potential growth of the companies can reflect the life of the investors as it uses several revenue generating factors such as brand, human capital and expectations and barriers to entry. Thus, this study investigated the effect of financial sustainability on the monetary policy transfer mechanisms in Iran. Indeed, the correlation between investor confidence in markets, money growth and economic growth, without Iranian crude exports, was analyzed alongside their volatilities. In particular, the heterogeneity of error variances in an MGARCH framework was used to obtain the estimated uncertainty criteria. In this paper, seasonal data and the variables from the beginning of 1991 to the end of 2016 were considered. The results showed that there was a positive correlation between macroeconomic volatility without oil and PEG investor confidence. The results showed that M2 cash flow fluctuation negatively affected PEG. The results also indicated a bilateral Grange impact between macroeconomic volatility without crude oil exports and Collapse"

Despite the numerous programs available to assist managers with the technical aspects of international trade (for example, the International Trade Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce), many owner-managers' worries and fears stemming from ""perceived barriers' go unattended, representing a real disincentive for small businesses to export (Joynt and Welch 1985). One ""perceived barrier"" that has received much recent attention from both the popular press and researchers is the difficult ethical problems that international trade may pose. Such problems appear to be a potent ""perceived barrier,"" in that many U.S. marketers report they tend to avoid foreign markets where they expect to encounter ethical dilemmas (Mayo et al. 1990). This ""perceived barrier"" may have a strong negative impact on the foreign trade intentions of small businesses, given that many have limited resources (such as having no legal or public relations specialists on staff) to wrestle with such ethical dilemmas (Ward 1987). Avoidance is only one of several options that small businesses may employ to cope with ethical problems. By including ethics in the strategic planning process and/or by developing codes of conduct, for example, small business managers may be able to anticipate and work through the ethical problems posed by some foreign markets (Robin and Reidenbach 1987). The success of such an approach, however, may partially depend upon how ethical concepts and problems are defined. Small businesses are more likely to implement codes and strategies where operational definitions of ethical concepts and problems have been developed (Ward 1987). A detailed listing of the type of ethical problems that might be encountered in international trade by small businesses, however, is currently not available. The sparse attention given to the ethical problems encountered by small businesses may have resulted from researchers' assumption that ethical problems bear equally upon firms of all sizes. This assumption may be misleading in that the type and impact of ethical problems may be different for small and large businesses (Longenecker et al. 1989). The present study determines the type of ethical problems that small businesses may encounter in international trade and how these problems may affect the firm and its management team. Since marketing activities are central to international trade and often are the focus of questions regarding ethical conduct (Fritzsche 1986), the present study will focus on the type of ethical problems that small business firms encounter in international marketing. METHODOLOGY The data for the present report were collected as part of a larger study by the author to ascertain the ethical issues confronting U.S. firms engaged in international business (Mayo et al. 1990). Sample The sample for the present study was selected from the District Export Councils Membership Roster (1987-1991 term, U.S. Department of Commerce 1987). District Export Council (DEC) members are experienced in international trade, are appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, and advise federal, state, and local governments and manufacturers on export-related matters. Consequently, it was assumed that the members would be well versed in international marketing and could comment on the nature of the non-domestic ethical problems encountered when selling transnationally. … Collapse"

The goal of this study is to estimate how hazard rates for remarriage vary among widows and widowers on the basis of both observable and unobservable characteristics. The remarriage estimates rely on nationally representative samples of widows and widowers from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Continuous-time hazard rate regressions indicate strong age and duration dependence effects for middle-aged widows and widowers and for older widowers. Among middle-aged widows, blacks and those with dependent children in the home have lower rates of remarriage. For middle-aged widowers, living in urbanized areas limits the prospects of remarriage. For older widowers, education and, to some extent, economic status appear to have positive effects on the remarriage rates. Overall, age and time since widowhood have the strongest and most consistent effects on remarriage rates for different widowed groups. Collapse"

This paper examines findings from the new ancestry question from the perspective of measuring ethnicity. The question adds little information about Hispanics, racial minorities, or recent immigrants, who can be identified readily on the basis of other census inquiries. The ancestry question allows us to characterize the descendants of European immigrants, but because of ethnic intermarriage, the numerous generations that separate present respondents from their forebears, and the apparent unimportance of ancestry to many whites of European origin, responses appear quite inconsistent. In regard to these groups, we may now be in an era of optional ethnicity, in which no simple census question will distinguish those who identify strongly with a specific European group from those who report symbolic or imagined ethnicity.

110602,1991,demography,movement toward stability as a fundamental principle of population dynamics,movement toward stability as a fundamental principle of population dynamics,"Although convergence to stability is typically a complex and irregular process, the Kullback distance provides a measure that moves consistently to 0 as a population becomes stable. The roots of the Kullback distance are in information theory. but it is a meaningful demographic quantity. It reflects a population’s log momentum, or the amount of growth built into a population’s nonstable age distribution. The rate at which the Kullback distance moves toward 0 is neither constant nor monotonic. At any point in time, however, it decreases by the covariance between a population’s age-specific growth rates and its log momentum. Although the present findings are couched in terms of movement toward stability, they are generally applicable because they relate to the behavior of any population at any instant. It is a fundamental principle of population dynamics that a population is always moving toward the stable population implied by its prevailing fertility and mortality rates, and that the extent of its movement is determined by the covariance between its age-specific growth and its log momentum.

Whereas I focused on how to avoid common mistakes in quantitative political sciences, Luskin clarifies ways to extract some useful information from usually problematic statistics: correlation coefficients, standardized coefficients, and especially R2. Since these three statistics are very closely related (and indeed deterministic functions of one another in some cases), I focus in this discussion primarily on R2, the most widely used and abused. Luskin also widens the discussion to various kinds of specification tests, a general issue I also address. In fact, as Beck (1991) reports, a large number of formal specification tests are just functions of R2, with differences among them primarily due to how much each statistic penalizes one for including extra parameters and fewer observations. Quantitative political scientists often worry about model selection and specification, asking questions about parameter identification, autocorrelated or heteroscedastic disturbances, parameter constancy, variable choice, measurement error, endogeneity, functional forms, stochastic assumptions, and selection bias, among numerous others. These model specification questions are all important, but we may have forgotten why we pose them. Political scientists commonly give three reasons: (1) finding the true model, or the full explanation; (2) prediction; and (3) estimating specific causal effects. I argue here that (1) is used the most but useful the least; (2) is very useful but not usually in political science where forecasting is not often a central concern; and (3) correctly represents the goals of political scientists and should form the basis of most of our quantitative empirical work."

110643,1991,econometric theory,who invented local power analysis?,who invented local power analysis,"The promotion of a market-oriented economic policy in China after 1978 set the stage for explosive growth in the number of peasant households shifting from subsistence agriculture to production for the marketplace. Though peasant households continued to produce quota grain for the state and used the free markets as an outlet for their sideline production, some households began to specialize in producing commodities primarily for the market. These entrepreneurial households seized on local and extralocal market opportunities and invested household savings or loans to open up a diverse range of petty commodity production. Peasant entrepreneurs drew primarily on labor power within the household, but as some businesses expanded, they began to hire kinsmen and fellow villagers. Rather than expend labor on less profitable grain production, many of these ""specialized households"" (zhuanye hu) chose to rent their land, negotiated share-cropping arrangements, or lent their land to kinsmen or neighbors who agreed to assume responsibility for the contracted grain quota. Some pooled their capital and labor power to form joint-stock companies or small private cooperatives in their villages and nearby marketing towns. Such private ventures have contributed significantly to the rapid pace of rural industrialization following market reforms. Many also specialized in commercial activity as merchants, distributors, peddlers, and shopkeepers. Their activities have sparked the beginnings of a commercial revolution in rural China. This article seeks to identify the institutional context that promotes or inhibits the rise of such peasant entrepreneurship in China after market reform. Despite the far-reaching institutional transformation of agriculture since 1978, there have been important areas of continuity with the past.

110646,1991,econometric theory,test consistency with varying sampling frequency,test consistency with varying sampling frequency,"In this issue of TRANSE'USION, Weiblen et al.' have compared the performance of nine Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed tests for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), by using a panel of 15 plasma or serum samples selected from random blood donors on the basis of low-level reactivity by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and positive reactivity on Western blot. These samples contained only low titers of HIV-1-specific IgG at endpoint dilution in a modified EIA using a class-specific antiglobulin conjugate. In a similarly modified immunoblot, HIV4-specific IgA was found in all the samples and HIV-1-specific IgM in all but one. The finding of some false-negative results with this panel in seven of nine EIA kits appeared to correlate with the narrow specificity of the kit conjugates for human IgG, rather than with the broader Ig class specificity of the conjugates in the more robust assays. Supplementation of the kit reagents with an anti-IgA or anti-IgM conjugate augmented the assay signal of most otherwise false-negative tests. Moreover, significant variation was observed between test results in two participating laboratories. This article addresses a number of issues that are important to users of screening tests for anti-HIV-1. These include 1) the significance of the observed differences in test kit sensitivity; 2) the potential value of enhanced sensitivity for IgM or IgA in EIAs for anti-HIV-1 and the potential problem of reduced specificity; and 3) the role of laboratory controls in ensuring the lot-to-lot consistency of HIV test kits. First, regarding differences among test kits, it bears mention that all commercially distributed lots of antiHIV-1 test kits must pass a test for sensitivity that uses a panel of samples prepared by the FDA. The use of this panel ensures that all kit lots have a minimum sensitivity that is sufficient to guarantee that failure to detect truepositive samples is rare. Indeed, discrepancies among test kits are generally difficult to demonstrate, requiring unusual samples with very low levels of antibodies to HIV-1, which are most often obtained from recent seroconverters. Although Weiblen et al. have not provided data on the frequency of weakly reactive samples that are positive by Western blot, others have found that the rate is quite low. For example, in donor testing by the American Red Cross, only nine samples with EIA optical density sample-tecutoff ratios of 1.0-1.2 have occurred among 3050 true positives since 1985 (Sandler S, written communication, February 1991). In view of these considerations, the discrepancies in kit performance that were obtained in the study may tend to overemphasize a fine difference in clinical sensitivity. An additional caution on the interpretation of these data would apply generally to conclusions based on any small set of samples, which may suffer from either random statistical bias or subtle biases related to the process of sample selection. Cautionary notes notwithstanding, product improvements that might result in earlier detection of antibodies to HIV-1 are certainly desirable. The reported finding of IgM in low-reactive donor samples is entirely consistent with previous findings in samples from persons with early infection.2 In my own laboratory, IgM, but not IgA, was detected in 10 of 18 weakly reactive samples from recently sermnverted homosexual men, and IgM was the only antibody detected in five s a m ~ l e s . ~ A finding of HIV-specific IgA has more often been associated with the diagnostic evaluation of HIV infection in neonatal patients.' Also noteworthy, however, is the fact that none of the 15 samples tested in the reported study lacked IgG, which leaves open the possibility that kit modifications other than broader Ig class specificity of the conjugates could reconcile the observed differences. Indeed, on several occasions, kit manufacturers have improved kit sensitivity by modifications of the HIV antigens rather than by changes in the conjugate. Detectable IgM may, however, antecede IgG in some cases, and, as reported, some weakly reactive samples might be detected more easily by the inclusion of anti-IgMor antiIgA-reactive conjugates. Historically, anti-IgM conjugates have been avoided in most indirect immunoassays. The reasons include the facts that IgG, when present, tends to dominate the assay; that IgM is usually a transient response and is not appropriate as the major target for detection; and that it is more likely that IgM will bind nonspecifically, thus reducing assay specifiicity. IgA detection has often been ignored because it is thought to be neither significant in the early immune response nor unique in the late response. The inclusion of detection conjugates for IgM or IgA in indirect EIAs would require the reoptimization of the assays in clinical trials, and products with increased sensitivity for screening might not be developed commercially if they proved to be less specific. The FDA could encourage development in this area by establishing HIV-specific IgM and IgA reference standards for release of kit lots. Unfortunately, efforts to date have been unsuccessful, either because of a low volume of an otherwise suitable serum or because of an insufficient titer of IgM or IgA in available samples. Collapse"

Furthermore, this property is invariant with respect to powers, matrix addition, and matrix multiplication. This result is applied to the derivation and interpretation of the inconsistency of the estimated coefficient variances when the error components structure is improperly restricted. This inconsistency is defined as the difference between the asymptotic variance obtained when the restricted model is correctly specified, and the asymptotic variance obtained when the restricted model is incorrectly specified; when some error components are improperly omitted, and the remaining variance components are consistently estimated, it is always negative. In the case where the time component is improperly omitted from the two-way model, we show that the difference between the true and estimated coefficient variances is of order greater than Nâ€“1 in probability.

We show, when the density of the error distribution is log-concave, that the maximum likelihood estimator exists with arbitrarily large probability for large sample sizes, and is asymptotically normal. The general theory presented here includes the important special cases of normal, logistic, and extreme value error distributions. The main results are established under rather weak conditions. It is also shown that, under the null hypothesis, the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic for testing a one-sided alternative hypothesis is a weighted sum of chi-squares.

110666,1991,econometrica,implementation of reduced form auctions: a geometric approach,implementation of reduced form auctions a geometric approach,"AN AUCTION IS A MECHANISM for allocating a single indivisible object to one of several competing bidders. The winner is the bidder who is awarded the object. The rules of the auction specify two functions. The first is the probability with which a bidder wins, as a function of everyone's bids. The second is the payment each bidder makes to the seller, as a function of all the bids and whether or not he wins. For instance, a first-price auction awards the object to the highest bidder with probability one (providing there are no tie bids), the winner pays his bid, and the losers pay nothing. The bidders in an auction differ significantly. These differences are captured by the bidder's type. A type may be the bidder's personal valuation of the object for sale, his degree of risk aversion, or perhaps his information about the object. (Maskin and Riley (1984) discuss a number of different economically meaningful examples of bidder types.) From the viewpoint of the seller and the other bidders, each bidder's type is a random variable. In this analysis we confine attention to auctions in which the types are independently and identically distributed according to a known probability distribution. The Revelation Principle asserts that every auction is strategically equivalent to an auction in which bidders bid by announcing their type and no bidder has any incentive to lie. Such an auction is called an incentive compatible direct auction. We will confine our attention to the probability functions for direct auctions, and let the incentive compatibility conditions restrict the payment functions. Each bidder can compute the probability that he wins, conditional on his own type, by averaging over the types of the other bidders. The function relating a bidder's type to his probability of winning is the reduced form of the auction. The literature on ""optimal"" auctions usually addresses the problem of maximizing expected revenue for the seller. For this purpose, all the relevant information about the probability function of an auction is contained in its reduced form. It is the reduced form that determines each bidder's behavior and hence the seller's expected revenue. In a symmetric auction each bidder's reduced form is identical, so that expected revenue is a functional defined on reduced forms, which are functions of one variable, namely, types. This makes the seller's problem somewhat tractable. To design an auction, a seller must be able to recognize a reduced form and recover the underlying auction. Reduced forms satisfy an intuitive feasibility condition. Given a set of types, the Collapse"
110677,1991,econometrica,a bargaining model where parties make errors,a bargaining model where parties make errors,"IN A NOW CLASSICAL PAPER, Nash (1953) studied the following bilateral bargaining game: The two parties state their demands simultaneously. If these are compatible with a feasible agreement, each party gets the utility corresponding to his demand. Otherwise both parties get their conflict payoffs. Under quite general conditions this game has a continuum of equilibria: Any possible agreement which is both Pareto optimal and individually rational corresponds to a particular equilibrium point. Recently, the literature on sealed-bid double auctions (see, e.g., Leininger et al. (1989) and Matthews and Postlewaite (1989)) has extended Nash's model to the case where each party has incomplete information about the other party's valuation. A common feature of these models is that they lead to an even larger set of equilibria and, thus, to an aggravation of the nonuniqueness problem. In the present paper, we will show that this problem all but disappears if a different kind of uncertainty is introduced into Nash's model, viz. if one assumes that the parties make errors in choosing their actions in the bargaining process. This modification will be seen to imply the existence of an equilibrium which Pareto-dominates all other equilibria. The rationale for our assumption lies in the implausibly precise coordination needed to induce equilibrium play in Nash's original model: each (nontrivial) equilibrium consists of a pair of demands that are just compatible. Even an arbitrarily small deviation (in the wrong direction) will reduce both players to their conflict payoffs. By adding error terms to tne bids, we get rid of this discontinuity and force the players to weigh their demands against the risk of breakdown. Thus, our assumption could be seen as a way of accounting for the strategic uncertainty which seems practically unavoidable in a game where strategies are continuously variable. More fundamentally, the errors may be thought to reflect the presence of some uncertainty about the exact values of relevant parameters. Formally, the errors will be modeled by letting a player's bid result from the addition of a stochastic term to his strategy. The rules of Nash's game will also be modified by allowing a surplus to be divided between the players. While in Nash's model the players get precisely what they have demanded even when demands are more than compatible, we make the more general assumption that some fraction (ranging between zero and one) of the unclaimed surplus is divided between the parties according to a surplus partition rule. A similar assumption is made in the above-mentioned incomplete information models, but the severe indeterminacy makes it impossible to assess its influence. The above described equilibrium properties of our model hold for errors of arbitrary magnitude. Naturally, it is particularly interesting to study the properties when errors go to zero. In the special case where no surplus is divided, we find a convergence to the Collapse"

From the standpoint of economic development, the central question regarding such resource transfers is quite straightforward, namely, How are such monies used? Do migrant workers channel international remittances into productive investments in their home communities, or do they use such monies merely to underwrite the consumption of newly desired consumer goods? Stated more baldly, do remittances from abroad help provide the investment needed to facilitate development, or do they merely foster new patterns of dependence on ""status-oriented"" consumer goods for migrant workers and their families? In the past many observers have taken a dim view of the economic impact of international remittances, primarily because they believe that the bulk of such monies is spent on personal consumption. In his review article M. Lipton, for example, maintains that ""everyday [consumption] needs often absorb 90% or more of a village's remittances"" and that ""investment is only the fourth [and last] priority for remittances.""' Similarly, Shahid Perwaiz in his analysis of remittances in Pakistan writes that most such earnings are ""frittered away in personal consumption, social ceremonies, real estate and price escalating trading.""2 Other country-level studies in Egypt, Turkey, and Yemen have lamented both the low levels of international remittance earnings that go into investment and the large amounts of such earnings that are spent on consumer durables, housing, and land.3 In more recent years several empirical studies have appeared to refine these rather pessimistic conclusions.

What will be the impact of high levels of petrochemical applications on the environment? How rapidly will the demand for energy grow, and how long will nonrenewable energy supplies last? Will global climatic change lead to the regulation or taxation of energy? How will agricultural productivity growth fare in the developing countries relative to the developed countries? What are the implications of these questions for the long-run research agenda in agriculture? These questions do not imply that there is a limit to growth. However, maintaining long-run growth potential in agriculture requires an appropriate level of investment in research to insure that we do not do irreparable damage to the environment and that cost-effective substitutes are available when petrochemical resources become depleted. We argue in this article that the threat to sustained agricultural growth, whether from pollution or resource depletion, comes mainly from energy consumption in the nonagricultural sector. We also argue that short-run price incentives are unlikely to encourage adequate investment in environmental protection, particularly in the developing countries and in research on alternative energy sources, and that this poses a threat to the sustainability of developing country agricultural growth.

The long-term objective of this project was to analyze strategies and to establish courses that will improve perception of agriculture programs among schools and communities in Uganda. Agriculture is evolving considerably due to advent of technology. As a result of climate variability and other land use demands, there has been considerable concern compounded with poor methods of farming in Uganda. Understanding the needs and development of agriscience programs is a big challenge confronting agricultural production in Uganda. This paper reports major concerns and possible solutions of improving agricultural programs through effective establishment of agricultural science curriculum. Introduction/Background Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils, regular rainfall and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, employing more than 84 percent of the total labor force and generating over 42.5 percent of the gross national product (WRI, 2000). Agriculture is the only suitable business venture for many people in local areas. Agriculture continues to decline every day, partly from shortage of labor, poor technology use, urbanization, and farm sizes resulting from land use land use competition (New Vision, 2005). Agricultural products supply nearly all of Uganda's foreign exchange earnings, with coffee (Uganda is Africa's leading producer) accounting for about 19 percent and fish 17 percent of the country's exports in 2002 (World Bank 2002). Uganda also exports non-traditional products including apparel, hides, skins, vanilla, vegetables, fruits, and cut flowers. AIAEE 22 Annual Conference Proceedings Clearwater Beach, Florida 362 Uganda's population is predominately rural; its population density is highest in the southern regions (Smit et al. 1994). Until 1972, Asians constituted the largest non indigenous ethnic group in Uganda. In that year, the Idi Amin regime expelled 50,000 Asians, who had been engaged in trade, industry, and various professions. In the years since Amin's overthrow in 1979, Asians have slowly returned and now number around 30,000. Other nonindigenous people in Uganda include Arabs, Western missionaries, NGO workers, diplomats and business people (Kyemba, 1977). The single most important cause for the persistence of low productivity in African agriculture is probably the extremely low level of fertilizer, which contrasts sharply with all other parts of the developing world (World Bank 1993). A study by FAO (1998) revealed that per capita use of total fertilizer nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium for sub-Saharan Africa and the other developing nations is extremely low. Farmers are resistant to fertilizer use due to cultural preferences and cost per unit. Because farmers need to be convinced concerning benefits of fertilizer user, there is a need for on-farm experiments (Gladwin et al. 1997). This study was concentrated on areas surrounding Mbale district of Uganda. Mbale district has a population of about 690,000 people. Over 91 percent of the population is rural, and the density is approximately 284 person per sq km. Mbale has been relatively prosperous in comparison with other areas in Uganda. It has reasonably favorable agro-ecological conditions including volcanic soils in much of the district, and fairly good rainfall. Because it borders Kenya, it has had access to Kenyan input and output markets. The western, relatively lower altitude, part of the district is quite well connected to Kampala and other urban centers of central and southern Uganda. Mbale town, the district capital, is about 240 km from Kampala along fairly good paved roads. Mbale district is also a site of the USAID-supported Investment in Developing Export Agriculture Project (IDEA) to help develop export-oriented agriculture, including major food crops such as maize and beans, as well as a wide range of food and nonfood income crops. Mbale is often seen as among the most agriculturally progressive areas in Uganda. There is an urgent need to target youth in agricultural development efforts. Ugandan youth currently have negative perceptions concerning agriculture. In view of this, the challenge is how institutions can effectively strengthen the livelihood and security of small-scale food producing communities. Small scale farmers are not focused on providing food for the world or contributing to the global economy, but rather on day-to-day subsistence and production of enough food to feed their families (Obbo, 1991). Therefore, incorporating agricultural sciences disciplines at the institute with Christian values will enhance agricultural production in Mbale and other parts of the country. MTI is a multi-level training program for Christians in Africa who want to develop Mbale community and Uganda in the long run through training. To ensure the success of a new curriculum at an institution, information about the educational needs of learners, available resources, and potential obstacles needs to be systematically collected and analyzed prior to the development and implementation of the actual curriculum (Mango, 1993) Purpose and Objectives The purpose of this study was to determine the needs associated with developing an agricultural science curriculum at MTI. As a result, agricultural production should be improved. The results of this needs assessment will assist MTI in implementing a full range of courses intended to introduce and to strengthen agriculture for rural Mbale. In order to begin this research, the following specific objectives were proposed: AIAEE 22 Annual Conference Proceedings Clearwater Beach, Florida 363 1. To determine the demographic characteristics of agricultural producers. 2. To assess basic needs related to agricultural production. 3. To identify cultural barriers related to modern agricultural technology. 4. To identify means of disseminating agricultural information to rural agricultural communities. The long term goal of Messiah Theological Institute (MTI) is educate students for Christian services, leadership and to teach students for Christian stewardship of sustainable agriculture. Research Methodology The study was conducted in the summer of 2005 in Mbale, Uganda. The information was gathered using one-on-one interviews, a research designed survey instrument, focus groups, observation and farmer-to-farmer visits. To collect reliable data, information was gathered from local leaders, government officials, local farmers, and faculty members at Messiah Theological Institute. During the focus group workshop, over 95% (N=37) of the respondents attended and shared topics such as important courses that should be in the curriculum, future sustainability of the institute and the long term benefits of the curriculum development. In this study, the use of multiple procedures to collect information was to enhance the validity and reliability of the study (Caplan, 1990). The research questionnaire included both open and closed ended questions on the needs of establishing agriscience curriculum and future sustainability of the institute. Prior to the study, a list of potential participants was compiled with the help from the faculty members at the Messiah institute from different districts in Uganda. A Likert-type scale was used for the closed ended questions. Participants Participants of both focus groups and farmer-to-farmer visits from six districts included farmers and youth from these areas. Farmers were asked to indicate the need of establishing an agriscience curriculum and what courses would they be interesting having their children study. During rural visits questionnaires were distributed to participants and collected after meetings that were organized by rural leaders. There were 77 participants in the focus groups. Meghan Ede (1998) maintains that focus groups can be used as a way to get people to talk about longterm issues that would take too long to study otherwise. Focus groups often bring out spontaneous reactions and ideas and allow the researcher to observe some group dynamics and organizational issues (Krueger, 1988). This methodology was very productive in terms of outcome from the groups in regards to courses and future of MTI. Instrumentation Several instruments were used to ensure that useful and appropriate information was gathered from the respondents. The one-on-one interview instrument was employed using a convenience sample of students (N=90) enrolled in short courses. The respondents were asked questions concerning the needs of setting up an agricultural curriculum. This methodology was particularly useful for getting the story behind a participant's experiences and knowledge in areas of agriculture. Interview questions were developed beforehand and specific content was identified. This type of interview involves the implementation of a number of predetermined questions and special topics (Berg, 1998). Rural visits were carried out to ensure representative sample of the farmers in Uganda was obtained. The choice of the districts was based on climatic conditions and crops variability as well landscape differential. During the rural visits, AIAEE 22 Annual Conference Proceedings Clearwater Beach, Florida 364 observation around and within the districts indicated that majority (>80%) of the farmers use poor methods of farming, limited use of fertilizer, poor transportation systems for their produce and lack marketing raw products such as mangoes. Observation also revealed that farmers lack extension professionals and economic resources to purchase improved seeds.

The goal is to promote development, help the poorer peasants, encourage innovations, and eliminate the reliance on the local allegedly monopolistic moneylenders. Credit is deemed appropriate for achieving these goals since it is easy to administer, its effect is immediate, and it can be directed to the desired groups in the population. However, experience has shown that credit programs tend to fail.' Subsidized credit introduces inefficiencies, most of the credit goes to the richer farmers, and it encourages capital intensification and replacement of labor by machinery-hardly the goals governments aim for.2 Cooperative credit was introduced in several places to improve distribution of subsidized loans and to increase repayment rates, but most of these efforts also failed.3 These failures of outside intervention can be explained within the perspective of modern theory, which has improved our understanding of (and increased our sympathy to) the working of rural credit markets and their institutions in poorer countries.4 Israel is not a poor country; its agriculture is well endowed with capital and is technically advanced, and while informal (gray) credit markets exist, most of the financial services are provided by commercial banks. Still, there are many similarities between the basic structure and problems of the credit market in Israel and those of developing countries. Central among them is the problem of control, which lies in the basis of the theoretical analysis and is of major practical importance both in rural credit markets for developing countries and in the cooperative-intensive Israeli farm sector. In this article we summarize lessons drawn from many years of experience with cooperative agricultural credit in Israel. The discussion is limited to the sector of the moshavim, cooperative villages of family farms; the experience of the large-scale communal kibbutzim is not considered at this stage. Collapse"

While some researchers find a negative relationship between export instability and economic growth, others find a positive relationship. A third group of researchers finds no significant relationship between export instability and economic growth in LDCs.1 Those who find a negative relationship between export instability and economic growth in LDCs stress the negative effect export instability has on the supply of output through the generation of uncertainty in long-term planning as well as due to shortages of inputs at critical times during the production process. Those who find a positive relationship between export instability and economic growth argue that LDCs respond to export instability by reducing consumption. This process, if repeated over a period of time, increases savings and hence the rate of investment. Those who find no significant relationship between export instability and economic growth argue that LDCs are able to anticipate the fluctuations in export earnings and plan for such fluctuations; hence instability in export earnings has no appreciable effect on economic growth. C. Moran investigates the relationships between domestic savings rate and economic growth rate on the one hand and export instability on the other, in a sample of LDCs.2 He finds that export instability has no significant long-run impact on either domestic savings rate or economic growth rate. However, over relatively short periods of time, export instability has a negative and significant effect on both savings and economic growth rate. The negative effect occurs when the negative effects of price and of quantity fluctuations reinforce each other. On the other hand, when the negative effect of price fluctuations is counterbalanced by the effects of quantity fluctuations, export instabil- Collapse"

Since government depends on a combination of taxes and aid, and external and domestic borrowings, the paper investigates the fiscal, monetary and balance of payments effects of the public sector and implications for private enterprise development. The paper finds that high levels of aid and fiscal revenues triggered by buoyant export markets in the 1960s anchored a Stalinist-Marxist style public sector expansion intended to build socialism alongside a state bureaucracy and one party politics. However, collapse of export commodity prices in the late 1970s repositioned the Malawi economy in such a way that costs of state hegemony emphasized its own economic vulnerability. Large fiscal imbalances emerged as apprehensions over loss of political control heightened by pressures of multiparty politics forced government to maintain the large public sector. Under pressure from oil price inflation, the influx of Mozambican refugees and drought, government resorted to higher levels of deficit monetisation and fiscal reallocations; giving priority to state enterprise subvention. These were manifested in reduced public investment, surging inflation and stagnation in per capita GDP. Implications of public sector expansion and government’s intransigence to reform include restrictive industrial, trade and financial policies that depressed savings, hindered private investments and encouraged capital flight. The policy also encouraged public sector inefficiency and resulted in high public deficits, increased foreign borrowing and recourse to credit from the domestic banking sector. These have had serious implications for crowding out the private sector and debt service and balance of payments problems. The new economic regime in Malawi advances Smithian ideals of a lesser role of the public sector aided by liberalization to eliminate price distortions, unrealistic interest rates and exchange rates. Privatization also aims to ease off fiscal pressures while industrial liberalization aims to develop a new competitive culture in business. Discriminatory tariffs have been abolished while liberal trade policies continually aim to integrate Malawi to world trade. Despite these initiatives, serious difficulties arise from downsizing of the public sector. The end of subsidization is manifesting itself into widespread joblessness. Macroeconomics of the market economy remain elusive and government is caught at a vicious intersection of rational economic reforms and fierce opposition from political activism. There is also rising disagreement over deflationary policies of the IMF. INTRODUCTION Public sector expansion Since the mid 1960’s the government of Malawi followed a policy of seeking comprehensive ownership of the means of production and also centralized management of the economy. This aimed to give the economy a state driven boost anticipated to trickle down to the poor masses, hitherto marginalized during colonial rule. Extensive government involvement in business via state enterprises spanning a wide range of private sector activities has been a key manifestation of public policy. On one hand, government created a publicly funded development bank, Malawi Development Corporation to establish private companies. On another, the government used the Agriculture Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC) to recycle profits from produce trading into state ownership of industry. Apart from direct investments undertaken by the state treasury in over 40 enterprises, government ministries also established more than a dozen commercial parastatals in the fields of agriculture, manufacturing, industry, mining, commerce and services. In addition, Press Corporation owned by Life President Banda undertook widespread acquisitions in strategic areas of the economy, consolidating itself into the largest single business conglomerate in the country. This paper investigates trends in growth of the public sector, its intermediate effects on fiscal policy choices available to the government and implications on budget management. The paper also examines intermediate effects of public sector growth on monetary policy choices available to the government, particularly in the setting or determination of interest rates and exchange rates. In view of government’s inevitable dependence on taxes, foreign aid and domestic and foreign debt, the paper also examines financial behaviour of the state in terms of tax policy, the role of aid, as well as accumulation of domestic and external debt. On the basis of these analyses the paper develops a cause-effect paradigm for public sector expansion and macroeconomic aggregates, and their implications for private enterprise. The main contribution of this paper to public sector economic policy is its role in the determination the speed and depth of public sector reform required to exonerate the economy from the fiscal burden of a large public sector and also create an atmosphere conducive to sustainable private enterprise development. Observations and Conclusions Public sector expansion in Malawi brings out two potentially illuminating courses of study. One course evokes a conception of the public sector as part of a nationalist political hegemony that subjugates private initiatives of the colonial establishment by introducing state sponsored competition in the private sector. This is to guarantee discontinuation of uncontrollable colonial business influence. The second conjures up the image of a government driven by the Stalinist-Marxist philosophy that the state should determine, inter alia, ""allocation of resources, distribution of income and consumption, levels of saving and investment, and relative prices of goods and services. This is intended to build socialism alongside one party politics and a state bureaucracy. The third course of investigation identifies economic successes engendered by favoured commodity export prices of the 1960’s and high levels of aid, as two factors that raised the appetite for government’s policy of comprehensive ownership of enterprise and direction of the economy as a result of a weak private sector at the time of independence in 1964. All three aspects are applicable, but despite the strongest philosophical tenacities, the collapse of export commodity prices in the late seventies repositioned the Malawi economy in such a way that the large public sector emphasized its economic vulnerability. However, the government sustained its intransigence to public sector reform, which was viewed synonymously with relinquishing an important instrument of political power.2 Despite its legitimate role as policy action for reform Malawi, state resistance to divestiture proposals were heightened by the fact that they coincided with pressures of multiparty politics in other African countries. Moreover, advocates of public sector reform were foreign agents like the World Bank, IMF and the USAID. Initially, higher levels of monetisation covered up the widening deficit resulting in a surge in average inflation to 15% per annum (1980-90). Per capita GDP had also stagnated within $160 -$170, while public investment dropped from 13.6% to 8.2% of GDP as a result of reallocating fiscal resources giving priority to state subvention also resulted in a drop in. As export commodity price deflation worsened from 3.8% per annum in 1975-84 to only 1.4% during 1985-89, escalating costs of imports under the influence of petroleum price inflation resulted in a widening external gap threatening balance of payments stability. In fact, as export price deflation worsened further to 0.2% per annum during 1990-98, the government increased foreign borrowing to conceal the gap despite conventional wisdom demanding enterprise restructuring.3 2 Low export prices weakened Agriculture; hence industry and service sectors. As GDP plummeted in the 1980’s Malawi saw both unemployment and inflation soaring, driving much of the country’s population below the threshold of poverty. Fiscal revenues also suffered while external value of the currency showed signs of fatigue as a result of declining reserves. Public sector imbalances worsened with declining levels of aid as a result of rising demand for foreign assistance to new democracies in Eastern Europe 3 Import prices rose by 6.4% per annum during 1975-84 and escalated to 8.4% per annum during 1985-89 The civil war in neighbouring Mozambique which forced a million refugees into Malawi, at a time when the country was also experiencing severe drought also exacerbated fiscal pressures on government. Growth for the period 1980-94 had plummeted to only 1.6 percent while the budget deficit escalated to 15 percent in 1994 reflecting unabated fiscal pressures. Under pressure from state subvention, the government merely shifted the resource hemorrhage to the banking sector. From only 2% in 1973, the share of bank credit consumed by parastatals had risen to 26% in 1978 while private sector credit suffered a corresponding reduction from 76% to only 51% of total credit. Against all the tenacity to maintain state enterprises, the reality had emerged that the sector had increasingly become a major liability to Malawi. From the highs of 9.5% of GDP in 1980 state enterprise contribution to national output was to only 3.9% in 1986. Contrary to government’s justification of the role of parastatals in industrial development, the share of public enterprises in non-agricultural activity was only 6% of GDP in 1991 compared to 11.7% in 1980. Despite consuming a large share of bank credit equivalent to 38% of GDP in 1986, the share of gross domestic investment attributed to state enterprises had declined to only 10.2% from 49.6% in 1980. In relation to national output, the share of public enterprises in gross investment also declined from 12.3% of GDP to a mere 2.2%. Initially, t Collapse"

With few exceptions, these studies use growth rates of exports as proxies for trade policies, on the assumption that EOPs lead to higher rates of export growth.2 A positive correlation between export growth and output growth is then interpreted as evidence of the superiority of EOPs over ISPs. In studies using a production function framework, a positive association between export growth (sometimes weighted by export shares) and output growth is taken to imply a positive contribution of EOPs to growth of total factor productivity.3 While results of these studies are frequently cited in the literature, J. Bhagwati has pointed out that they do not ""bear directly on the question whether the EP [export promotion] strategy is productive of more growth, because the incentive-related EP strategy is not the one used to examine the question of income or growth performance. It is necessary to identify whether the superior export growth rates (or higher export magnitudes) belong to the EP countries.""4 It should be pointed out here that cross-country studies occasionally do refer to evidence in support of their use of export growth rates as proxies for trade policies. One such study by J. B. Donges and J. Riedel, based on a time series analysis of 12 countries, found partial support for such a relationship; in four of the countries the shift toward EOP was attended by a decline in the trend rate of export growth, and for a fifth country the positive shift in export growth was statistically insignificant.5 Similar results were obtained by B. Balassa for an overlapping group of countries.6 While these studies suggest a connection between trade policies and export growth over time for individual countries, they do not constitute evidence of such a connection across Collapse"
110718,1991,economic development and cultural change,tax base erosion in developing countries,tax base erosion in developing countries,"It is widely believed that the tax base in most developing countries has been severely eroded by legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion, brought about largely by poor' tax administration.1 This erosion, it is thought, has had a variety of fiscal effects: tax revenues are lost and the growth of the tax base is dampened, the progressivity implied by the statutory rate structure is not achieved, the costs of tax administration are increased, and horizontal and vertical equity suffer because the effective tax rates faced by individuals depend largely upon their success in playing the tax compliance game. It is not surprising, therefore, that virtually all fiscal reform programs in developing countries start with the promise to improve administration. Better administration is a discretionary government action that at once can lower the tax rate, increase revenues, slow capital flight, and improve the fairness of the system. Yet tax base erosion in developing countries is something about which precious little is known, and, in particular, the empirical evidence about the severity and the nature of the problem is all but nonexistent.2 Why do we know so little about the dimensions of the evasionavoidance problem? One reason is conceptual problems in measuring erosion of the tax base. For example, how does one estimate the substitution of nontaxable for taxable compensation in response to the tax structure, or the extent to which a higher marginal tax rate has induced individuals to report less of their taxable income? Another reason is the problem of comparability across countries. The many legal and Collapse"

Generally speaking, three branches of the pertinent literature can be identified. One branch consists of case studies of arms-producing less developed countries (LDC APs) to assess the level of sophistication and the volume of arms produced in LDCs as well as to explore the economic consequences of'indigenous arms production.' A second branch investigates the impact of LDC military spending on specific macroeconomic aspects, such as the impact on inflation, the impact on employment, budgetary trade-offs, military research and development (R & D) and technology transfer issues, and so on.2 The third branch, covering possibly the most prominent and most widely researched topic, directly relates military expenditures to rates of economic growth, sometimes as time-series for specific countries, more often as cross-sectional studies for a given year. The dominant finding is that increases in military expenditures are causally and negatively related to rates of economy-wide growth.3 A number of scholars report contrary findings, however. Some, for example, Chan, Hsiao, and Keng, Evans, as well as Biswas and Ram, find that defense spending and economic growth appear unrelated. Others, most prominently Frederiksen and Looney (summarized, e.g., in Looney), discover that the defense-growth relation differs across country groups of interest.4 Frederiksen and Looney's work in particular submits that the negative impact of military expenditures on economic growth is mitigated in the case of those LDCs that engage in some arms-production activities. But why does this effect occur? I suggest in this article that in the case of LDC APs some part of military expenditures must be invested in the domestic economy for Collapse"

Even in cases where currency overvaluation is clearly a major cause of an acute balance of payments crisis, the governments of developing countries are frequently reluctant to devalue, apparently for three main reasons: (a) they doubt that export production, import demand, and domestic expenditures are very responsive to a change in the exchange rate (""elasticity pessimism""); (b) they fear the potentially disruptive side effects of devaluation on inflation, employment, and output growth as well as on real wages and income distribution; and (c) they want to avoid political risk.' The focus of the present study is on the effects of devaluation in the deficit-prone least developed countries where a large part of the population barely survives on a subsistence wage. To be wholly successful, devaluation generally requires a reduction of real wages to encourage the expansion of exports and of import substitution without a contraction of national income. Hence our lead question: Is devaluation an appropriate method of economic stabilization in the least developed countries where a decrease of real wages or earnings could result in severe economic hardship or even starvation? More specifically, the aim of our study is twofold: (1) to investigate the short-to-medium-term effects of devaluation on macroeconomic performance in the least developed countries, subject to the condition that real wages or earnings Collapse"

It turns to a specific country setting, Peru, as a means of illustrating the discussion. The depth of Peru's economic problems makes it likely that the Peruvian economy will have to undergo major adjustments in the near future. Among the options policy makers will consider are : realignment of the various exchange rates, trade liberalization, removal of price distortions, and reduction of government expenditures. The analysis presented here shows how household level data can be used to assess the effect of various policy options on the welfare of the poor. Several facts suggest that correcting many of the distortions affecting Peru's agricultural sector may not directly harm the poor. For Peru's urban sector, the case is more complicated. If food subsidies and taxes were dropped, the net (immediate) effect may well be favorable as the prices of wheat and wheat products, a major staple, would decline substantially. Other government programs, including those related to health and education, could be changed in ways that would benefit the poor, and in some cases, reduce overall public sector expenditures.

It has been proposed that in a market economy the efficient allocation of research resources requires the resources to be allocated to develop new technology that saves the increasingly scarce factors of production or to technology that can be applied to commodities that have larger market demand.

A fertility decision making model of farm housholds is outlined and hypotheses presented. An overview of demographic technological and economic changes in Thailand is then provided. Analysis found fertility decline in rural Thailand to be concurrently related to transformations in agricultural production and institutions brought about largely from land- and labor-saving technology induced by high wage rates and specialization. Decreasing birth control costs may have also played a contributory role in the decline. Government policy should therefore aim to foster further agricultural development and increased farm household income while making family planning and health care services available to farm households at lower costs. Alleviating poverty in part through cottage industry facilitating land-saving technological change and promoting higher education for rural youths should be governmental priorities. Collapse

Although the quantity of capital and labor are central in many theoretical models of output determination, the empirical evidence from growth-accounting models indicates that the amount of capital and the hours of labor employed account for only a small proportion of the growth in per capita product.' On the basis of these findings, theorists have extended growth-accounting models to identify other factors that stimulate growth. According to the findings of these models, quality and deployment of inputs, organizational modes, and technology are all keys to growth.2 By making changes and investments that affect these factors, countries can move toward greater growth and development. Of the resources available to low income countries, labor remains the most abundant. These countries can thus achieve major gains in output through labor investments. Whenever a country reallocates labor from lowto high-productivity activities and sectors, whenever it improves labor quality through education and training, it fuels economic growth. An extensive empirical literature documents the direct productivity-enhancing effects of human capital in the agricultural as well as the industrial sectors.3 Most institutions and researchers concerned with development acknowledge human capital development and deployment as a central source of growth and especially per capita growth.4 Representative of this perspective are G. Psacharopoulos and A. Arriagada, who view limited human capital development as ""the Collapse"

Benoit first provided evidence of a link between the rate of economic growth and defense spending, a number of scholars have reported their research on the subject.' Their results have been varied, some concluding the relationship is positive, others concluding the opposite. Recently, some have argued that no general and significant link exists for less developed countries (LDCs) and have suggested that the varied results are due primarily to varied specifications, sample periods, and differences among countries.2 S. Chan goes further by suggesting that researchers deemphasize the search for universal links and concentrate on time-series as opposed to cross-section analysis. He also recommends that explanations of the defense spendingeconomic growth link take into account, among other things, a country's capacity utilization, total foreign receipts, and fiscal and monetary policies.3 The point of departure for the research reported here is a paper by R. Faini, P. Annez, and L. Taylor (hereafter FAANTA).4 Their analysis concludes that higher defense burdens are associated with lower growth rates across countries. However, I will argue that they have either misstated or misinterpreted their primary result, and, furthermore, that there are some serious problems with their analysis and the underlying model. These problems aside, the FAANTA model either already includes or can be respecified to include most of the features recommended by Chan. Therefore, I will estimate a significantly modified version of their model for African and Latin American countries (after attempting to replicate their results for these two regions).

First, the Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RPYS) is applied to a large publication set on climate change of 222,060 papers published between 1980 and 2014. The references cited therein were extracted and analyzed with regard to publications, which are cited most frequently. Second, a new method for establishing a more subject-specific publication set for applying RPYS (based on the co-citations of a marker reference) is proposed (RPYS-CO). The RPYS of the climate change literature focuses on the history of climate change research in total. We identified 35 highly-cited publications across all disciplines, which include fundamental early scientific works of the 19th century (with a weak connection to climate change) and some cornerstones of science with a stronger connection to climate change. By using the Arrhenius (1896) paper as a RPYS-CO marker paper, we selected only publications specifically discussing the discovery of the greenhouse effect and the role of carbon dioxide. Also, we focused on the time period 1800-1850 to reveal the contributions of J.B.J Fourier in terms of cited references. Using different RPYS approaches in this study, we were able to identify the complete range of works of the celebrated icons as well as many less known works relevant for the history of climate change research. The analyses confirmed the potential of the RPYS method for historical studies: Seminal papers are detected on the basis of the references cited by the overall community without any further assumptions."

Along with the scientific research have come growing alarm and calls for drastic curbs on the emissions of greenhouse gases, as for example the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC [I990]) and the Second World Climate Conference (October I990). To date, these call to arms for forceful measures to slow greenhouse warming have been made without any serious attempt to weigh the costs and benefits of climatic change or alternative control strategies. The present study presents a simple approach for analyzing policies to slow climate change. We begin by summarizing the elements of an economic analysis of different approaches to controlling greenhouse warming. We then sketch a mathematical model of economic growth that links the economy, emissions, and climate changes and summarize the empirical evidence on the costs of reducing emissions and concentrations of greenhouse gases and on the damages from greenhouse warming, relying primarily on data for the United States. The different sections are then integrated to provide estimates of the efficient reduction of greenhouse gases, after which the final section summarizes the major results. Collapse"

110792,1991,economic journal,employee share ownership and privatisation:  a comment,employee share ownership and privatisation a comment,"The paper is based on an econometric model for 15 manufacturing industries. It analyses the causes and the effects of FDI in a small open economy in transition during 199197. The model comprises of panel data with 1050 potential observations (10 variables x 15 industries x 7 years). The hypotheses tested are derived from the theory of investment location for a small open economy where comparative advantages, industrial organisation and market structure form the basic determining factors of the industrial structure of FDI inflows. The experiments with our models indicate that the key variable on the side of determining factors of the industrial structure of FDI was the capital per labour ratio. It is evident that after 1994 the role of capital was overshadowing the role of labour in attracting the FDI. The new FDI ventures into the Czech economy are biased in favour of capital intensive industries. As a variable of minor significance there was observed the role of increasing returns to scale. We cannot confirm that there were other significant “causes” determining the FDI during the whole studied period because a part of them could have been correlated with effects of FDI. On the side of effects of FDI on firms, there were several variables that were statistically significant: the level of profits, total factor productivity and the development in prices measured by producer price index. The latter factor has been universal to all patterns of Czech incoming FDI flows both in time and space (industries). From the very onset, foreign investors into the Czech manufacturing were strongly biased to investments into those industries where the index of inflation was higher than average. This is a classical explanation of location activities built into the foundations of comparative advantages and shared by both the Ricardian and the Stolper-Samuelson models. Natural resources or human capital endowment in industries were not among the factors that influenced significantly the decision-making about FDI. The facts revealed in this paper are of a crucial importance for the policy-making. We have found that there are only very weak causal links in the Czech economy for the attraction and the success of FDI. The majority of phenomena distinguishing the firms (industries) with FDI from indigenous firms can be derived from the effects of FDI. As a consequence, we cannot expect that indigenous firms would enjoy the same natural “comparative advantages”, which were observed to have been developing in firms with FDI. If this trend would continue, the gap between the foreign and the indigenous enterprises would be widening. The benefits of FDI could be then internalised exclusively in recipient enterprises and the indigenous firms would fall out off the competition. Having been singled out as outsiders, they would sink Address of the authors: Charles University, FSV-IES, Opletalova St. 26, CZ-11000 Prague E-mail: benacek@mbox.fsv.cuni.cz down to a group of other indigenous firms competing among themselves at the margin of survival. 1. FDI as an Engine for Survival Czech economic transformation had its ups and downs. In 1990 it commenced in a hind position, with hardly any experience from entrepreneurship under its “reformed” central planning and with households lacking capital for the initiation of large-scale investments. With these adverse endowments being given, betting on FDI would be a very promising strategy for securing the future growth. Nevertheless, Czechoslovak government opted at that time for a very different strategy in the large-scale businesses. By giving priority to the voucher privatisation scheme and the scheme of sales to Czech owners (Mejstrik [1996]) it set forth for a highly unorthodox avenue of self-reliance. The ensuing intransparent ownership and perverse objectives of the quasi-owners had a long-term impact on the performance of firms and the Czech society. Though still accepted as an important means of privatisation, the FDI remained a less-favoured child that was assumed to be strong enough to care for himself. Without doubt, the stress on one’s own capacities was a dire undertaking, which was at first criticised by IMF and the World Bank, but very soon it became the Czech most admired achievement. Unfortunately, in 1996 there were first signals that indigenous Czech firms lagged behind the firms with foreign capital . Czech privatisation strategy was a bet on odds that it could be possible to build capitalism without capital. This was an impossibility theorem, which had to fall down on the new Czech capitalists-to-be. The accumulation of capital was a necessity and the indigenous firms had to act in such a way that instead of concentrating on the restructuring of production, they had to cope with corporate property control, equity transfers and the acquisition of assets under their own management. Many of these acts were illegal 2 and their effects on the firms were negative. The necessity to close the widening trade balance deficit during 1994-97, the government had to proceed with restricting both the monetary and the fiscal policies. That brought the frail Czech firms to a test of survival during 1997-98. In the same period there was a sharp change in the views on ownership. The openness to FDI became the mostfavoured policy for not only all liberal parties, but also for the trade unions and Socialists. Unfortunately, foreign investors became very cautious and the changeover to a new strategy remained to a large extent without practical response. Now it looks evident that those firms that succeeded in attracting FDI were those more lucky ones where the growth of production was combined with high wages and high profits. Since only a minority of firms succeeded in that, the Czech economy was slowly progressing into a system of dual set of firms distinguished by speed. On one hand there are the indigenous firms that press for low wages, government bailout schemes and the soft legislation. On the other hand there are firms with foreign capital that can withstand appreciating exchange rate and still increase its market competitiveness and capital returns. 1 The first studies in this respect were by Benacek, Zemplinerova [1996] and Zemplinerova, Benacek [1996] and [1997]. These studies covered the full sample of firms with employment over 24 employees (altogether over 3000 enterprises) and their conclusion was less optimistic than what was found in the study by Djankov and Hoekman [1998] who used a selected pattern of 513 firms. 2 The word “tunnelling” became a synonym for ingenious schemes of asset stripping and rent-seeking, which have left the majority of indigenous corporations and banks in debts. On top of its inefficient acquisition, the extracted “authentically private” capital was often either sent abroad or spent on imports of consumer goods. Under this “division of roles” in entrepreneurship there is a rising danger that the gap between these two groups will even deepen and thus perpetuate the existing split. Thus in 1999 approximately a half of the firms in the Czech economy were firms able to stand on their own with a prospect for gaining profits. The majority of these were firms with foreign capital. The remaining half (or a third, in the better case) of all firms is now challenged by either pending restructuring or liquidation. Since it is not very likely that the weakened indigenous Czech corporate sector would be able to recover with the help of their own means, there are two alternatives left which may do the job. The first one is the government bailout. Because the Czech propensity to save is extremely high and also the taxes are very high, the means so available are substantial. The present Czech government thinks that there may be a hope for chance. Their problem is only managerial: who are those clerks and entrepreneurs who will administer and use these means productively? With the lack of them one can have doubts there may be anything perspective in this scheme. The other chance left to the ailing indigenous enterprises rests in their association with the foreign capital, either in joint-ventures or by their direct takeovers by foreign firms. Unfortunately we can doubt that the FDI entry into Czechia would change its strategy and, instead of concentrating on green-field investments (as was clearly the situation since 1996), it would return back to acquisitions and mergers. If this would not be the case, the only possibility then remains that the FDI firms, which have now become leaders in the Czech economy, would have positive spillover effects on the rest of the economy. So, at this stage of development, the Czech economy would be helped more by means of externalities spinning off from foreign to indigenous firms than by direct effects on productivity in the firms under foreign control. It is the aim of this study to analyse more closely how the foreign investors behaved in the past, what were the determining factors for their activity, what were the industrial patterns, which attracted their attention and how was it with their effects on the economy. 2. The Data and the Variables Used in this Study This study builds on the experience we developed during our empirical tests from the previous paper (see Benacek and Visek [1998]). The data in the former study were based on a single year 1994 and comprised 91 industries. The problem was that we lacked the time dimension and the picture we have received was generally static. Nevertheless, we have discovered that the industries with a massive presence of FDI behaved to a large extent differently than the industries without that financial support. In this paper we have grouped the manufacturing data into 15 industries classified according to NACE 2-digit nomenclature. We have clustered some industries because we did not have the FDI data for all industries in the required structure. The intensity of FDI in the given industry i (as the Collapse"
110798,1991,economic journal,"efficiency wages, monopoly unions and efficient bargaining",efficiency wages monopoly unions and efficient bargaining,"There are two leading models of wage determination for the unionised sector of the economy. The first, which is labelled the monopoly model (MM) by Oswald (I985), assumes that the union sets the wage and the employer chooses the profit maximising employment level. The second, which is labelled the efficient bargaining model (EBM) by Oswald (I985), notes that both sides can improve on the monopoly outcome by jointly bargaining over wages and employment. A key strategy in empirically distinguishing between the two models has been to determine whether the employment-wage pair appears to be off the firm's demand curve for labour.1 For example, Brown and Ashenfelter (i 986) use the significance of a measure of alternative wages in an employment regression as evidence for the EBM. Efficiency wages hypotheses (in various forms) have been used to explain why non-union firms might find it profitable to offer wages above marketclearing levels.2 While paying high wages entails direct costs, this practice may result in benefits such as high worker effort, low turnover, or a large supply of labour to the firm. One motivation for this literature is to explain involuntary unemployment: if the efficiency wage framework is valid, then firms may not lower wages even in the face of excess supplies of labour (Stiglitz, I987). An additional motivation of this literature appears to be the empirical observation that interfirm or inter-industry wage differentials remain even after most possible economic determinants of these differentials have been controlled (Krueger and Summers, I988). Further, these differentials appear to lower quits and raise the length of queues of job seekers attempting to gain entry. They suggest the existence of rents associated with efficiency wages (Katz and Summers, I 989). If any version of the efficiency wages story is correct, then there are reasons for believing that workers' alternative wages will affect employment in the unionised sector even in the absence of efficient bargaining. Intuition suggests that an identical regression to that proposed by Brown and Ashenfelter (I986) would yield a significant alternative wage in the non-union sector of the economy, since the marginal revenue product of labour is affected by alternative wages Collapse"

Three time periods, based on the prevailing view of education governance and the role of the State, are identified: 1975–1990, 1991–1998 and 1999–2002, respectively. For each period, the context/agenda, processes and outcomes of education policy are discussed. The article is based on statistical data, public reports, policy documents and interviews with central and local actors in the field of education. It is concluded that access to education has increased at all levels during the last 25 years. However, young people's transition to the labour market takes place later, has become more complicated, and in reality requires successful completion of at least upper-secondary education. In the wake of reductions, decentralization and deregulation of education, the differences and divisions between municipalities, schools and different pupils have increased. It is argued that active efforts to counteract such tendencies were weak in the 1990s, and that education politics may instead have reinforced social division and exclusion. Collapse"

The paper focuses on the structure of taxation for countries which are engaged in tax competition and on potential gains from s tax harmonization. We show that if the competing countries are sufficiently coordinated with the rest of the world then tax competition leads each country to apply the residence principle of taxation and there are no gains from tax harmonization. If, however there is not sufficient coordination,tax competition leads to low capital income taxes and the tax burden falls on the internationally immobile factors. The outcome is nevertheless still efficient relative to the available constrained set of tax instruments. Collapse"

However, the nature of the Organization's pricing policy has been rather fluid, so that individual members have some degree of freedom regarding the determination of their actual government selling price. Using standard econometric tools, this paper models the speed and degree of adjustment of the official crude oil price of selected OPEC members to changes in the spot price as a means of capturing the aggressiveness with which their crudes have been marketed since the mid-1970s. The study is carried out both for the entire period as well as, separately, for weak and tight market phases. It is found that, while it may be true that OPEC broadly determined the oil price structure for the period under investigation, the actual pricing behaviour of individual members differed as the more enterprising members were better at exploiting market opportunities to their advantage under different market conditions.

One of the most interesting cases is the calculation of the real cost of electricity, because of the complexity of its generation and distribution process. This cost is sometimes estimated by means of large computerized models of the energy sector, but usually the lack of detail in such models gives unsatisfactory results. For many sectoral studies an overall average is not sufficient, especially when cost differences from sector to sector are significant, as for example in the case of rural electrification, where the real cost of electricity is in general much higher than the national average, because of outstanding transmission and distribution expenses. This paper describes a simple but systematic marginal cost approach for the estimation of the cost of electricity delivered to rural regions by paying particular attention to the distance of the final consumer from the grid and the seasonability of rural demand patterns.

This paper analyzes trends in the index over the latter part of the 19th century. The results indicate that during this period, industrialization and the associated changes in the nature of the business enterprise resulted in a rapid declinne in occupational segregation by gender, as measured by the index. This decline occurs earliest in cities experiencing early industrialization. Index estimates are presented for the United States and for selected midwestern cities, and changes in the index are decomposed into occupational mix effects and sex composition effects. Occupation-specific index changes are used to identify which occupations influenced changes in the overall index. The results indicate that the dynamic occupational shifts of the 19th century set the stage for the “men's jobs” and “women's jobs” that have been so persistently stable in the 20th century.

The first is, Does the potential for lower production costs lead to partial or complete monopolization of an industry through acquisition by one firm of all its rivals? The second is, Do competitively advantageous cost reducing mergers necessarily result in a lower equilibrium market price? These questions are addressed in terms of a two-stage noncooperative game in the first stage of which n owners, possessing n firms and producing a homogeneous product with a strictly convex cost function, bid for the possession of each other firm and then, in the second stage, operate the firms they acquired. Analysis of pure strategy subgame-perfect Nash equilibria of the game provides a mixed message. On one hand, there is no fear of complete or even substantial partial monopolization for industries with sufficiently numerous firms. But, some partial monopolization is possible and any such monopolization results in a product price increase and a total industry surplus decline. Collapse"

An attempt is made by means of entropy indices and shift-share analysis to determine if diffusion in those industries conforms to the product-cycle model. We employ primarily state-level data derived from County Business Patterns and supplemented by US. Censuses of Manufacturing and Services. Our findings indicate that all the industries displayed substantial increases in employment and considerable dispersion, although by no means were the changes uniform. The hypothesis that the dispersion is following the product-cycle model, that is, from core areas to peripheral regions, receives little support from this study. The model, however, should not be rejected out of hand, because all three industries studied have a duality in the size of firms that the data masks. This duality may affect the applicability of any model. Further attempts to explain the spatial distribution of any of these industries should begin with disintegrated data.

The key finding is that while overall increases in the proportion of Medicare enrollees who use home health services and the average number of visits received were relatively small, they were much greater than they would have been without the Prospective Payment System. The introduction of prospective payment for Medicare hospital services appears to have increased Medicare outlays for home health by an estimated 25%. In an effort to reduce patient stays, it appears that hospitals discharged more patients to home health and that home health users were discharged earlier, thus increasing both the number of users and the number of visits received per user. The study also found that changes in nursing home bed supplies and Medicaid reimbursement rates appear to bring about changes in home health use.

This paper presents information from the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey to describe the phenomenon of multiple nursing home admissions and to examine the effects of multiple admissions on the number of individuals who would be fully covered by ""front-end"" policies. For example, in contrast to an expected 51% of admissions that would be fully covered by a 3-month benefit, we estimated that only 39% of cases would be fully covered after adjusting for multiple admissions.

Employment-based insurance programs are starting to face this same issue in paying HMOs. Because input prices are related to population density, payment levels could be related to density. This paper offers a new measure of density that represents the population density for the average person. Using zip-code-level data, this measure calculates density of a county weighted by the population of the zip code. Payment areas can be devised by using the measure to categorize counties. This approach can be applied to paying physicians, hospitals, and HMOs. Collapse"

Yet there has been little economic analysis of the effect of AL on individuals' uses of health services and total health care costs. Our model yields both cost and usage impacts. A 1% increase in short-term AL events implies a 1.9% increase in costs; subsequent AL increases costs by .6%. A 1% increase in short-term NA events implies a 1.3% increase in costs; subsequent NA increases costs by 1.5%. Initiation of AL directly lowers NA, but indirectly increases NA usage (and hence, costs) in subsequent treatment. Overall, a 10% increase in AL leads to a 9.2% increase in health care costs.

We use descriptive statistics to develop an insurance profile of respondents with severe physical disabilities, and multivariate procedures to model differences between privately and publicly insured, disabled persons. Results of logistic regression procedures indicate that respondents with private insurance alone are more likely to have a high functional level, a positive perception of their health, and to be married, than are those with public (or a combination of public and private) insurance. Specific type of disability, age, and wheelchair use were also found to predict the type of insurance, their effects largely mediated by employment status and income. Collapse"

It is likely that this disease will help catapult us into health care reform in the current decade. Hopefully, health services research on HIV disease will contribute to the debate on what the nature of this reform should be. We need to understand the implications of access barriers facing those with no insurance as distinct from those with public insurance. We must grapple with and understand the implications for estimating the costs of AIDS, of open-ended, publicly funded acute care for persons with HIV. Furthermore, we must understand the long-term care needs of chronically ill AIDS patients with frequent periodic life-threatening acute events and the optimum structure(s) necessary to provide such care. Above all, we must be sensitive to the rapidly evolving treatments for HIV and the fact that these can make cost projections completely obsolete almost before they are made. Health services research on HIV disease must, of necessity, focus on many of the traditional themes of our emerging discipline. At the same time, the fact that it is an infectious disease with an observable transformation into a chronic condition has implications for the way we study it and how we define the emergence of clinical disease. This has implications for how we conduct health services research on the entity and may push us toward a new set of methodologies that borrow more from epidemiology than cost accounting. Collapse"

We also examine the impact of state confidentiality policies on the testing decision.

The impact of these programs is determined using a statistical model that controls for variations in organizational characteristics of 56 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans, the health care market of the individual Plan, and several state and federal health care regulations. The statistical results indicate that over the entire period 1980 to 1988, preadmission certification, concurrent review, and denial of payment (as a part of the retrospective review program) programs were associated with lower hospital admissions, and fewer inpatient days and payments per 1,000 members. Mandatory second surgical opinion did not have a statistical impact on hospital utilization and payments. The aggregate reduction in hospital payments for all Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans with both a preadmission certification and concurrent review program was estimated at $2.55 billion in 1988 dollars.

Financial performance of teaching hospitals in the VA system was no worse than nonteaching peers even without a teaching subsidy. Residents were found to provide patient care but this contribution to output was offset by indirect teaching costs of resident training. Physicians were less productive in teaching hospitals, possibly reflecting the time spent in training and supervising residents, while nurses were more productive. Finally, as staff size increases, the indirect costs of medical education decrease. Future downsizing of residency programs would financially benefit smaller-staffed VAMCs; larger-staffed facilities would lose. Collapse"

111380,1991,international journal of forecasting,professional forecast error as a function of a variable forecast horizon:  a decomposition analysis,professional forecast error as a function of a variable forecast horizon a decomposition analysis,"Abstract This paper analyzes forecast precision as it pertains to four major us macroeconomic variables from 1983.II through 1988.III. The data set, comprised of Blue Chip consensus predictions of approximately fifty economists and informed business professionals, sequentially lengthens the forecast horizon from one through four quarters. Applying the Theil Mean Square Error measure to the forecasts of the Fed Funds rate, money growth, and inflation, the results show prediction accuracy declining as the forecast window is lengthened. Conversely, for real GNP growth, forecast accuracy improves with a longer horizon. A decomposition analysis of the errors reveals further insight into the nature of professional prediction performance. For all four variables, forecast bias is shown to be a systematic influence in the errors. This is especially true for inflation. Additionally, at longer horizons (with the exception of real GNP) we find slope error growing as the dominant systematic influence, replacing bias in the forecast error. This finding indicates forecasters are, in general, unable to anticipate changes in direction for these variables over time. Our results suggest that forecasters, in addition to more accurately tracking trend determinants, can improve prediction performance by more closely monitoring those factors which produce turning points in the data.

Consequently, the role of domestic factors has generally been ignored or downplayed. This article begins with the observation that leaders confronted with external threats make trade-offs between the pursuit of external alignments and the mobilization of domestic resources. It then argues that the choice of strategy depends on a combination of systemic and domestic factors, including the perceived degree of external threat to state security, the perceived degree of domestic instability and threat to the government, and the constraints that derive from the domestic political economy. The analysis of Egypt's alignment behavior during the period from 1962 to 1973 underscores the impact of domestic and economic political constraints on the choice of domestic mobilization or alliance formation and the central role of alliances in providing resources for confronting domestic as well as foreign threats.

111445,1991,international organization,invested interests:  the politics of national economic policies in a world of global finance,invested interests the politics of national economic policies in a world of global finance,"Capital moves more rapidly across national borders now than it has in at least fifty years and perhaps in history. This article examines the effects of capital mobility on different groups in national societies and on the politics of economic policymaking. It begins by emphasizing that while financial markets are highly integrated within the developed world, many investments are still quite specific with respect to firm, sector, or location. It then argues that contemporary levels of international capital mobility have a differential impact on socioeconomic groups. Over the long run, increased capital mobility tends to favor owners of capital over other groups. In the shorter run, owners and workers in specific sectors in capital-exporting countries bear much of the burden of adjusting to increased capital mobility. These patterns can be expected to lead to political divisions about whether or not to encourage or increase international capital market integration. The article then demonstrates that capital mobility also affects the politics of other economic policies. Most centrally, it shifts debate toward the exchange rate as an intermediate or ultimate policy instrument. In this context, it tends to pit groups that favor exchange rate stability against groups that are more concerned about national monetary policy autonomy and therefore less concerned about exchange rate stability. Similarly, it tends to drive a wedge between groups that favor an appreciated exchange rate and groups that favor a depreciated one. These divisions have important implications for such economic policies as European monetary and currency union, the dollar-yen exchange rate, and international macroeconomic policy coordination.

111451,1991,international regional science review,"exports, impacts, and locations of services producers",exports impacts and locations of services producers,"The literature on FDI determinants indicates that MNEs allocate their investments among countries to maximize their risk-adjusted profits (Caves, 1974). These profits may depend on three groups of factors belonging to the eclectic OLI paradigm developed by Dunning (1979, 1993, 2003, 2009): (a) “Ownership advantages”, that is, firm-specific factors enabling the firm to grow more successfully than competitors in the home or host countries (i.e. proprietary technology and management expertise); (b) “Location advantages”, that is, location-specific factors in the host country that make it the best location for the firm to do business (i.e. cheap labor cost, growing market size, and good infrastructures); and (c) “Internalization advantages”, that is, factors associated with the firm’s trade-off between FDI and exporting or licensing (i.e. trade barriers, and difficulties in finding a trustworthy licensee). The main location determinants identified by both location theory and research on the “L” advantages are: (i) “traditional location factors” (i.e. labor costs and availability; labor skills and labor unionization; market size and market potential; competitiveness level and density; land costs and availability; agglomeration economies ; transportation costs and other costs – taxes and financing); (ii) infrastructures, services and intangible assets; (iii) environmental and social context; (iv) policy framework; (v) information costs. The literature on foreign direct investments has mainly analysed the location strategies of MNEs across national borders, but there have been few studies of location decisions by foreign investors within the borders of a single country. The literature on the location determinants of inward FDI within Italy is scant. Mariotti and Piscitello (1995) in their analysis about crossborder takeovers involving Italian industrial firms in the period 1986–91, find that the spatial distribution of inward FDIs is mainly governed by information costs. Besides, Basile et al. (2005) explore the determinants of MNEs’ location choices in 52 EU regions, including Italy, in 1991-1999. It results that Italian regions are doomed by the “country effect” and indeed attract less than their potential. This is mainly explained by the national policies and institutions, which might have discouraged foreign firms to plant their affiliates in Italy. Finally, Bronzini (2007) investigates the role of localization economies, urbanization economies, and of host country’s size in attracting FDI within the 103 Italian provinces in the period 1997-2004. The author finds that localization economies are important in attracting FDI, while there is no evidence that FDI inflows are drawn by the sectoral diversification of the Italian provinces. Besides, localization economies play a role mainly in the industrial sector, while within services these types of externalities are insignificant. By contrast, small firms hamper investment in both industry and services. Moreover, the presence of small firms deters foreign investment while that of big firms has no impact on foreign investors’ decisions. All the studies mentioned above have focused on the head offices’ location, mainly because of data availability (Mariotti, Mutinelli, 2016). Nevertheless, the geography of FDI location is better explained by the location of the FDIs’ establishments especially when the industry of investigation is manufacturing. Indeed, while head offices may privilege urban areas, and largest cities, which offer firms advantages linked to: urbanization and localization economies, market size and potential, skilled labor force availability and business opportunities, transportation accessibility, and connectedness with the rest of the world, FDIs establishments may follow different location patterns (i.e. land availability, localization economies, financial incentives, etc.), settling down in peripheral areas. Cities, mainly global cities, contribute to a reduction in foreign investors’ foreignness liability (Nachum, 2003; Goerzen et al., 2013) because they can reduce the uncertainty of foreign operations, offering global connectedness , cosmopolitanism, and the abundance of advance producer services and information (Castellani, 2016). Moreover, they also offer advantages in accessing the market, and therefore tend to attract market-seeking investments. Moreover, agglomeration economies enhance creativity (Florida, 2005) – they are the favourable location for talents and the best creative minds –, efficiency (Combes et al., 2012), and innovation (Acs, 2002). Nevertheless, even negative aspects characterize largest cities, i.e. excessive agglomeration and congestions problems that lead to higher costs and lower quality of life. This explains why some MNEs’ activities (i.e. logistics) that require large areas in which to operate are mainly located outside – but near to global cities (Holl and Mariotti, 2017). The same holds true for R&D activities that require the construction of large laboratories which is best outside global cities, in areas that are still agglomerated and which offer a quality of life that is attractive to the most skillful (Castellani, 2016). Finally, peripheral areas should attract more labor intensive activities, in which production costs are relatively higher. The present paper enriches the debate on the attractiveness of Italy towards manufacturing FDIs by concentrating on the location of the establishments of manufacturing foreign affiliates in the 110 NUTS3 provinces at the year 2012. Data on inward FDIs, and their establishment location, are provided by the Reprint database. The paper is structured into six sections. The introduction is followed by a concise literature review on the location factors, and on the perception of entrepreneurs. Section three is dedicated to data and methodology. Descriptive statistics and econometric analysis are presented and discussed in sections four, and five, respectively. Conclusions and further research questions follow. REFERENCES Acs Z.

Most small developing countries do not have the conditions necessary to make productive investments in agricultural biotechnology, except possibly for sharply defined tissue-culture activities.

Most farms in the area are family farms, and such farm households are being exhorted to diversify their sources of income and to reduce their reliance on agriculture. Based on surveys in 1988 and 1989, this study finds, to the contrary, that only a small proportion of farmers has been reducing reliance on agricultural sources of income, and few anticipate a declining share of their household income to come from farming. Most farmers are loathe to undertake ancillary non-agricultural occupations because of the lower status implied; and farmers in the study area are found to have a very poor understanding of the broad policy context within which they produce. The paper also confirms the finding of other studies that off-farm employment of household members makes a significant contribution to farm household income; and the nature of such pluriactivity and of pluriactive farm households in the area is reviewed.

111536,1991,journal of the american statistical association,statistical inference: likelihood to significance,statistical inference likelihood to significance,"Abstract The concepts of likelihood and significance were defined and initially developed by R. A. Fisher, but followed almost separate and distinct routes. We suggest that a central function of statistical inference is in fact the conversion of the first, likelihood, into the second, significance: a linking of the Fisher concepts. A first-order asymptotic route for this is incorporated into most statistical packages. It uses the standardized maximum likelihood estimate, the standardized score, or the signed square root of the likelihood ratio statistic as arguments for the standard normal distribution function, thus giving approximate tail probabilities or observed levels of significance. Recent third-order asymptotic methods provide a substantial increase in accuracy but need the first derivative dependence of likelihood on the data value as an additional input. This can be envisaged as the effect on the likelihood function of dithering the data point. Extensions to the multivariate, multiparameter cont... Collapse"
111541,1991,journal of the american statistical association,sliced inverse regression for dimension reduction,sliced inverse regression for dimension reduction,"Abstract Modern advances in computing power have greatly widened scientists' scope in gathering and investigating information from many variables, information which might have been ignored in the past. Yet to effectively scan a large pool of variables is not an easy task, although our ability to interact with data has been much enhanced by recent innovations in dynamic graphics. In this article, we propose a novel data-analytic tool, sliced inverse regression (SIR), for reducing the dimension of the input variable x without going through any parametric or nonparametric model-fitting process. This method explores the simplicity of the inverse view of regression; that is, instead of regressing the univariate output variable y against the multivariate x, we regress x against y. Forward regression and inverse regression are connected by a theorem that motivates this method. The theoretical properties of SIR are investigated under a model of the form, y = f(β 1 x, …, β K x, e), where the β k 's are the unknown... Collapse"

The -consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator are established. Furthermore, IPW-SIR is adapted to deal with the challenging case when both the response and the predictors are missing at the same time. The superior performances of the proposed estimators over existing methods are demonstrated through simulation studies as well as analysis of a HIV clinical trial data. Collapse"
111553,1991,journal of the american statistical association,transformations in density estimation: rejoinder,transformations in density estimation rejoinder,"In this paper we concentrate on the estimation of loss functions using nonparametric methods. We focus on the parametric transformation approach to kernel smoothing introduced by Wand, Marron and Ruppert (1991) and compare it with the standard kernel estimator and the multiplicative bias correction method (Hjort and Glad, 1995 and Jones, Linton and Nielsen, 1995). We advocate in this paper that the transformation method behaves excellently when it comes to estimating actuarial and financial loss functions. It is a very suitable approach when estimating functions with a lognormal type of shape. Loss functions have typically one mode for the low loss values and then a long heavy tail (Klugman, Panjer and Willmot, 1998),. We show by a simulation study that the method is able to estimate all three possible kind of tails, as defined in Embrechts, Kl*ppelberg and Mikosch (1999), namely the Fr’chet type, the Weibull type and the Gumbel type. This makes this method extremely powerful specially for actuaries at all levels, i.e. the non-life actuary calculating the risk of his auto claims, when a life actuary consider the risk of a group life insurance, or when these actuaries consider the relevant price for a reinsurance contract, where the reinsurer takes over the risk corresponding to the tail of the distribution. Besides, when the actuary calculates the total risk of a portfolio, perhaps using the famous recursion formula of Panjer (1981) or some more recent generalisation of this formula, then the loss function of the individual claims is needed. We show that our version of the transformation principle of Wand, Marron and Ruppert (1991) is able to estimate the risk of a heavy-tailed distribution beyond the data. A heavy-tailed distribution is here of Pareto shape. When we use our non- parametric estimator to fit the closest possible Pareto distribution in the tail we see, that at least for the estimator we tried out in our simulations, then our method performs much better than the Hill estimator (Hill, 1975), that is widely used in actuarial science and finance, see Embrechts, Kl*ppelberg and Mikosch (1997, p. 330) and Danielson and Vries (1997). On top of this, our estimation technique does not have to bother about where the tail begins such as the Hill estimator has to. This is often a difficult question and fatal errors leading to massive economic losses may happen. The beginning of the tail can be estimated by a methodology that can be compared to the trade-off between bias and variance in kernel density estimation, but the only (to our knowledge) published method on this (see Hall,1990) involves sub-bootstrapping, that is hard to understand and implement for the practitioner (see, Danielson and Vries,1997). Recently another method has appeared, namely the semiparametric robust estimator of Feuerverger and Hall (1999). Compared to this estimator, our proposal has the advantage of being directly linked to the non-parametrically estimated loss function. The connection between the loss-function and the tail index is therefore immediate in our estimator of the tail index. We consider this to be a considerable competitive advantage of our method when it comes to the application in the fields of actuarial and financial loss functions. We believe that our method is a big jump forward for the practitioner, whether it is an actuary or a financial analyst, to get a quick and easily understood estimator of all the things he needs to know about his loss distribution, using a moderate computational effort. The organisation of the paper is as follows: in section one there is an introduction to the estimation of loss functions. Section two presents the theoretical properties when using a fixed transformation in kernel density estimation, and afterwards, section three explains the transformation algorithm that is proposed in this paper. Section four is devoted to the applications, two examples of actuarial loss function estimation are presented. They analyse automobile claim data. Finally, section five describes the results of a large simulation study that shows the performance of the different kernel methods when estimating loss function curves and their tail index, i.e. when describing their behaviour in the tail.

111560,1991,journal of the american statistical association,sensitivity in bayesian statistics: the prior and the likelihood,sensitivity in bayesian statistics the prior and the likelihood,"Abstract One paradigm for sensitivity analyses in Bayesian statistics is to specify Γ, a reasonable class of priors, and to compute the corresponding class of posterior inferences. The class Γ is chosen to represent uncertainty about the prior. There is often additional uncertainty, however, about the family of sampling distributions. This article introduces a method for computing ranges of posterior expectations over reasonable classes of sampling distributions that lie “close to” a given parametric family. By treating the prior as a probability measure on the space of sampling distributions this article also gives a unified treatment to what are usually considered two separate problems—sensitivity to the prior and sensitivity to the sampling model. First the notion of “close to” is made explicit. Then, an algorithm is given for turning ratio-linear problems into sequences of linear problems. In addition to solving the problem at hand, the algorithm simplifies many other robust Bayesian computational pro... Collapse"
111561,1991,journal of the american statistical association,an approach to robust bayesian analysis for multidimensional parameter spaces,an approach to robust bayesian analysis for multidimensional parameter spaces,"Abstract In some multiparameter Bayesian problems the prior is more naturally described as a joint density for all of the parameters and in others it is more naturally described as a product of marginal and conditional densities. Although ordinary quantile, e-contamination, and density-ratio classes of priors may be sensible choices for robust Bayesian analyses in the former case, they may be less satisfactory in the latter. This article shows how to construct product classes of priors for use in the second case, using one class of priors for the marginal and another for each conditional. Then the article introduces density-bounded classes as an alternative to the more familiar classes for representing uncertainty about the prior. It is often of interest to find tight bounds on posterior expectations as the prior ranges over the class of priors—an apparently difficult nonlinear optimization problem regardless of which class of priors is used. This article describes a technique for turning the problem into... Collapse"
111562,1991,journal of the american statistical association,a lack-of-fit test for the mean function in a generalized linear model,a lack of fit test for the mean function in a generalized linear model,"Abstract A supremum-type statistic, based on partial sums of residuals, is proposed to test the validity of the mean function of the response variable in a generalized linear model. The proposed test does not need a partition of the space of covariates to handle the case of nonreplication. The new test is consistent against the alternative, under which the deterministic part of the model is not the one specified in the null hypothesis. The asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic can be approximated through simulations. This approximation is valid even if the variance of the response variable is misspecified in the model. For practical sample sizes, the adequacy of this large-sample approximation to the null distribution of the test statistic is carefully examined. Power comparisons with other lack-of-fit tests are also performed to show the advantage of the test. In particular, we find that the new procedure is rather sensitive to detect a misspecified mean function, if the assumed mean functio... Collapse"
111563,1991,journal of the american statistical association,smooth goodness-of-fit tests: a quantile function approach,smooth goodness of fit tests  a quantile function approach,"Abstract A quantile function based analog to Neyman's smooth tests for goodness-of-fit hypotheses is developed. These procedures possess asymptotic and small-sample power properties similar to those for smooth tests. They are, however, computationally simple, applicable to both complete and Type II censored data, and easily focused in the direction of any specific set of alternatives. These results are used to develop a new test for exponentiality. Only location/scale null hypotheses will be considered. The ideas are easily adapted to other types of nulls, however. Neyman first proposed smooth tests for the goodness-of-fit hypothesis. As stated by Kopecky and Pierce and by Rayner and Best, the basic idea behind these tests is to embed the null density in a larger exponential family. The procedure is then based upon the likelihood-ratio test statistic for testing that the additional parameters equal zero. Smooth type tests may be viewed as a compromise between omnibus test procedures, with generally low po... Collapse"
111569,1991,journal of the american statistical association,the draft lottery and voluntary enlistment in the vietnam era,the draft lottery and voluntary enlistment in the vietnam era,"A combination of voluntary enlistment, armed forces eligibility criteria, and the failure of draftees to avoid conscription jointly determined the racial composition of the Vietnam-era armed forces. Administrative data show that men with draft lottery numbers that put them at high risk of conscription are overrepresented among men who voluntarily enlisted in the military, but that the effect of the lottery on enlistment is stronger for whites than for nonwhites. Minimum Chi-Square estimates of enlistment models for the 1971 draft lottery suggest that nonwhites were more likely than whites to prefer enlistment to a civilian career. This finding appears to explain racial differences in the effect of the lottery on enlistment. Contrary to the findings of a recent congressional study, the Vietnam-era estimates presented here suggest that conscription of a relatively small number of whites and nonwhites in a manner proportional to their prevalence in the population might substantially reduce nonwhite representation in the armed forces.

111572,1991,journal of the american statistical association,a flexible and fast method for automatic smoothing,a flexible and fast method for automatic smoothing,"Abstract The choice of smoothing parameter or bandwidth is crucial when applying nonparametric regression estimators such as kernel estimators. The optimal choice depends on the data at hand. A data-driven bandwidth selection, close to the optimal one, would make these curve estimators objective, more reliable, and easier to use. Minimizing residual mean squared error criteria, such as cross-validation, have been frequently proposed to estimate the optimal smoothing parameter. Empirical and theoretical evidence indicates that cross-validation rules and related methods lead to rather variable estimated optimal bandwidths. The method presented here builds on estimating the asymptotically optimal bandwidth from the data. Since estimators for the residual variance and for an asymptotic expression for the bias are plugged into the asymptotic formula, such selection rules are called “plug-in” estimators. The functional that quantifies bias is approximated by the integrated squared second derivative of the regre... Collapse"
111573,1991,journal of the american statistical association,choosing a range for the amount of smoothing in nonparametric regression,choosing a range for the amount of smoothing in nonparametric regression,"Abstract Most nonparametric regression estimates smooth the observed data in the process of generating a suitable estimate. The resulting curve estimate is sensitive to the amount of smoothing introduced, and it is important to examine the estimate over a range of smoothing choices. An objective way to specify such a range is to estimate the optimal value of the smoothing parameter (bandwidth) with respect to some loss function and then report a confidence interval for this parameter estimate. This interval suggests examining three regression estimates: an undersmoothed curve evaluated at the lower endpoint of the confidence interval, an oversmoothed curve evaluated at the upper endpoint, and also an optimal curve chosen by the data-based method. This article describes two strategies for constructing such confidence intervals using asymptotic approximations and simulation techniques. Suppose that data are observed from the model Yk = f(tk ) + ek (1 ≤ k ≤ n), where f is a function that is twice differentia... Collapse"

The model for s(x) is a functional form that depends on a finite number of unknown parameters. Two statistics, Λ and Λ w , are proposed that measure the level of agreement between the model fit to the data and the nonparametric kernel estimator on m preselected points in U. Conditions are given under which Λ and λ w , are asymptotically equivalent. Both of these statistics measure overall lack of fit and are related to the deviance. Their asymptotic distribution under the null model and under local alternatives is derived. This work is motivated by the local mean deviance plot of Landwehr, Pregibon, and Shoemaker for assessing overall lack of fit in logistic regression. Their plot is summarized by our test statistics and is extended to other likelihood based regressions of Y on x. Collapse"
111578,1991,journal of the american statistical association,influence functions of iteratively reweighted least squares estimators,influence functions of iteratively reweighted least squares estimators,"Abstract The iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm is routinely employed to evaluate robust regression estimates. The importance of beginning the algorithm with a robust estimator of the unknown parameters is often stressed. The precise influence of the initial estimator on subsequent iterates or the limit of such estimators, however, does not seem to have been calculated previously. Because robust regression involves the downweighting of specific points having large rescaled residuals and/or large leverages in the design space, it is natural to think in terms of the weights themselves, rather than some less intuitive function such as the η function of generalized M estimators. Therefore, we consider multiple linear regression by the method of weighted least squares, where the weights are estimated quantities depending on both position in the design space and the residual relative to an initial regression estimator. The influence function of the weighted least squares estimator is shown to depend... Collapse"
111579,1991,journal of the american statistical association,goodness-of-fit analysis for the cox regression model based on a class of parameter estimators,goodness of fit analysis for the cox regression model based on a class of parameter estimators,"Abstract In this article we propose a class of estimation functions for the vector of regression parameters in the Cox proportional hazards model with possibly time-dependent covariates by incorporating the weight functions commonly used in weighted log-rank tests into the partial likelihood score function. The resulting estimators behave much like the conventional maximum partial likelihood estimator in that they are consistent and asymptotically normal. When the Cox model is inappropriate, however, the estimators with different weight functions generally converge to nonidentical constant vectors. For example, the magnitude of the parameter estimator using the Kaplan–Meier survival estimator as the weight function will be stochastically larger than that of the maximum partial likelihood estimator if covariate effects diminish over time. Such facts motivate us to develop goodness-of-fit methods for the Cox regression model by comparing parameter estimators with different weight functions. Under the assume... Collapse"

The methods used here are derived from work by Zellner, Hong, and Gulati (1990) aimed at analyzing forecasts of turning points. Here, these methods are adapted so that they can be used to analyze existing regional leading-indicator series and to develop new improved versions of such series. The innovative aspect of this study is the use of the time series observations on the measure of economic activity that we wish to predict along with an explicit definition of a turning point, either a downturn or an upturn. We then establish a predictive relation between the composite indicator series and the variable measuring economic activity that allows a Bayesian computation of probabilities associated with the turning-point events. These probabilities are conditioned on the past data and the predictive pdf for future observations. Probabilities for the turning-point events make it quite... Collapse"

Thanksgiving Day both marks and proves to participants their ability to meet basic needs abundantly through consumption. So certain is material plenty for most U.S. citizens that this annual celebration is taken for granted by participants. Not just a moment of bounty but a culture of enduring abundance is celebrated. This article draws on ten data sets compiled over a five-year period. We interpret the consumption rituals of Thanksgiving Day as a discourse among consumers about the categories and principles that underlie American consumer culture. That is, Thanksgiving Day is read as an enacted document orchestrated symbolically and semiotically through consumption. The cultural discourse of Thanksgiving Day negotiates meanings and issues in both the domestic and national arenas that are difficult for many to acknowledge, articulate, and debate verbally. Through the use of multiple perspectives and sources of data, we attempt to elucidate both the emic and etic meanings of this holiday. Collapse"
111666,1991,journal of development economics,public policies and saving in developing countries,public policies and saving in developing countries,"Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a life-saving treatment for many incurable diseases. BMT presents a valid treatment option for many congenital and acquired disorders of the hematopoietic system, including several hematological malignancies [1–4]. In BMT, failing bone marrow is supplemented by hematopoietic stem cells derived from peripheral or umbilical cord blood; therefore, BMT may also be described as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [5]. Indonesia has a long involvement with BMT services. In 1987, the first allogeneic and autologous BMTs in Indonesia were performed in Semarang, Central Java by Telogorejo Hospital and Dr. Kariadi General Hospital. These transplants were performed for several cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and thalassemia [6]; two of the cases of AML treated in Semarang in 1987 are still in remission. Two year later in 1989, Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta performed several BMTs for CML, AML, ALL cases [7]. In 1989, Dr. Kariadi General Hospital, in collaboration with Dr. Sarjito Hospital in Jogyakarta, performed BMT for a patient with AML. Then, in 1991, Hasan Sadikin Hospital in Bandung, in collaboration with Telogorejo Hospital, performed an autologous BMT for a case of AML and the patient survived for 3 years. However, none of these efforts resulted in a sustained and effective Indonesian BMT. Semarang is the capital of Central Java Province, Indonesia. It has an area of 373,78 km and a population of ~1,729,428 [8]. There are 7 public hospitals and 12 private hospitals in this city, with Dr. Kariadi Hospital being the city’s National Referral Hospital [9]. In 2012, Dr. Kariadi Hospital committed to establishing a modern BMT. Steps taken towards achieving this goal comprised of: [1] developing a Road Map for BMT services [2]; formalizing collaborative international partnerships; [3] developing appropriate clinical and laboratory infrastructure [4]; increasing human resources capacity [5]; developing clinical teamwork; and [6] fostering pharmacy services. Our team started with creating a policy framework for BMT procedures. This framework, our Road Map, is shown in Fig. 1. We began by holding BMT meetings to increase knowledge and skill for nurses, technicians, and doctors. Then, in collaboration with Singapore’s National University Hospital (NUH), one doctor, two nurses, and one analyst were sent to NUH’s BMT unit. They studied BMT-specific clinical capacities, apheresis, specific clinical nursing, and stem cell processing. One clinical pathologist was also trained in Dr. Soetomo Hospital in Surabaya in stem cell processing. Next, we invited a group known as the C2C Foundation to improve our team’s knowledge about BMT for thalassemia cases; this project involved 16 doctors and 37 nurses. Then, in 2012 and 2014, in a preceptorship program run in collaboration with the i-CML Foundation, we sent a doctor to Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) in South Australia to study CML management and BMT services. Our short storage protocol calls for the suitable stem cells to be processed with RPMI, gentamicin, free preservative heparin, and held at 4 °C for a maximum of 72 h. For long term storage, we deep freeze our samples to –80 °C after processing it with DMSO 5% [10, 11]. Total Nucleated * Damai Santosa santosaiva@yahoo.com Collapse"
111680,1991,journal of econometrics,a bayesian approach to testing the arbitrage pricing theory,a bayesian approach to testing the arbitrage pricing theory,"Abstract We consider new methods of testing the restrictions imposed on asset returns implied by an equilibrium version of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory. In the competitive equilibrium version of the APT [see, for example, Connor and Korajczyk (1988)], excess returns on a collection of portfolios or individual assets are related to measured factors in a multivariate regression model without intercepts. The traditional significance testing approach uses estimates of these intercept terms and a likelihood ratio procedure for statistical testing. In our approach, we quantify differences between the restricted and unrestricted models by computing posterior model probabilities. These posterior model probabilities are combined to form posterior odds ratios which represent the weight of prior and sample evidence for or against the pricing restrictions. A dramatic simplification of the odds ratio calculation is achieved by using the Savage density ratio method. The special structure of the APT model with factors extracted by principal components is exploited to produce a simple prior. The sensitivity of the odds ratio to different prior specifications is explored. We apply these new methodologies to tests of the APT with a collection of ten size-based portfolios. The factors are extracted by a principal components technique developed by Connor and Korajczyk using all listed AMEX/NYSE firms over the period 1964–1983. The odds ratios show that the sample evidence is weak and does not favor the APT pricing restrictions. We are able to gauge the strength of the evidence in the data by examining the sensitivity of the odds ratio to the prior. Collapse"

Consistent with time-series cross-sectional studies, the variance is assumed constant within subgroups of observations, but may vary from group to group. We also consider the likelihood-ratio (LR) test, and develop a number of modified LR statistics similar to those of Bartlett. Each test is developed in the context of regression where the vector of coefficients may be constant for all groups or may vary between groups. A number of sampling experiments reveal that if the disturbance terms are normally distributed, Bartlett's test is slightly more powerful than either of the jackknife tests. However, in nonnormal situations JACK2, the test based on jackknifing the regression, is very robust (under H 0 ) and has substantial power against a number of alternative hypotheses. Collapse"

Throughout we assume that the parameter of interest is a linear combination of period means in the analysis-of-variance model. Results from spectral theory are used to obtain manageable expressions for the variance of the BLUE of this parameter. Relative efficiencies of the BLUE for rotating panels with different rotation periods are presented, e.g., for the period means themselves, of differences, or of averages of means. Moreover we present bounds on the relative efficiency which are valid irrespective of the parameter of interest. The analysis shows that the gains from choosing an optimal rotation design can be quite substantial, even if the cost of a reinterview equals the cost of a first observation. In many cases either the smallest or the highest possible rotation period is optimal. The analysis is illustrated with an empirical example concerning monthly consumer expenditures on food and clothing. Collapse"

Action is triggered when the state of the economic system reaches the boundary of the ‘region of no action’. In this note, first-order conditions for the choice of the region of no action, and for the type of action to be taken, are established, assuming that the uncontrolled state variable follows a diffusion process. The generic name for these conditions is ‘smooth pasting’ or ‘high contact’ conditions; they require that marginal utility should take the same value before and after the action has been taken. In this note, we show that, in some cases, these conditions involve the first derivatives of the value functionm of the dynamic program, while, in other cases, they involve the second derivatives and require a higher form of tangency which Dumas (1988) called ‘super contact’.

Three different legal mechanisms for creating efficient incentives are examined in turn. The first mechanism uses the legal rule of strict liability to internalize costs. The second mechanism uses a negligence standard to create and enforce efficient standards of behavior. The third mechanism uses law to channel transactions into voluntary exchange. The initial explanation of the three mechanisms makes simplifying assumptions of perfect information, solvency, costless dispute resolution, and risk neutrality, before examining the results of relaxing these assumptions. The rules of the three major bodies of liability law—property, contracts, and torts—will be analyzed as examples within these three mechanisms. Property law concerns appropriation of ownership rights or interference with them; contract law concerns broken promises; tort law concerns accidental or intentional harm to people or property.

It attempts to explain the origins of the expansion of liability; to present examples of its effects on product and service markets; and to analyze the extensive efforts of the past five to six years toward liability reform, efforts which I conclude have had only a slight relationship to the underlying sources of modern liability problems. Though the empirical evidence is thin, virtually all studies of the effects of specific modern rules demonstrate that modern tort law has substantially dislocated product and service markets, as one might expect of an assertive legal regime founded on largely noneconomic principles.

111752,1991,journal of economic perspectives,a flawed ideological critique,a flawed ideological critique,"r\rom the original Berle and Means (1932/1991) provocative thesis about the increasing un JOaccountability of professionalized managers to shareholders of corporations to the imposition of principal-agent prescriptions on altruistic and competent public officials, who actually engages in rent-seeking behavior in increasingly globalizing economies, is a remarkably un discussed issue. With the original critique of rampant rent-seeking within private sector governance structures, the ""slur"" of rent-seeking has found its way, via ideological projection, onto the shortcomings of bureaucratic processes and public officials operating under competing fiscal and complex rationalities. An historical and ideologized projection of such dysfunctions within public sectors writ-large has occurred namely in the hands of neo-classical and public choice economic theorists. Yet such a portrayal of public sector bureaucratic rent-seeking may be just a convenient and convincing rhetoric to mask the ultimate rent-seeking behaviors of other powerful actor groups. Governments have clearly been persuaded by the rhetoric as is evident in their promulgation of strategic policies related to enhancing global business opportunities which, seemingly, benefit elite capitalists to the exclusion of just about everyone else. The neo-classicists, by condemning their public bureaucracies as the cause of inefficiency and rent-seeking set governments along destructive paths of action which reduce state capacity and open up traditional government businesses to the private sector. Highly controversial assumptions are the basis upon which a remarkable edifice of small, impotent and de-skilled governance has been ""reinvented."" The ungovernability thesis is an effective way of linking both an economistic and libertarian wish to reduce government, but rent-seeking assertions under-pinning privatization and outsourcing rationales continue to ignore the pressing questions about the structure of organization and the pathologies of managerial prerogatives-an ignorance that severely distorts organizational and inter-agent complexities confronting the requirements of a re regularity governance imperative in globalizing and vulnerable economies. Outsourcing, as the newer legitimizationfor downsizing, de-skillingpublic sector competencies and reducing agency mandates, should be construed as a form of long-term capture of the public sector, by both corporate and management-consultant interests alike. Conflict of interest requirements on behalf of politicians and senior bureaucrats apart, outsourcing needs to be construed as asset stripping-a form of fiscal ""corruption"" in the hands of oligarchs within the private sector who remain prime beneficiaries of such arrangements and, more disconcertingly, by public sector oligarches now pressed into the legitimization services for such ""corrupt"" practices-all in the name of effecting putative efficiencies in globalized public sectors.

Children in three age groups (6, 8, and 10) were given four dollars either in cash or in the form of a credit card to spend in an experimental store. They were told that any money or credit they did not spend they would receive in cash to take home with them. The major finding was that those children who did not receive allowances at home spent more in the credit than in the cash condition, whereas those who got allowances spent the same amount whether they were given cash or a credit card. Neither the age of the children nor any other background variables affected the amount spent in the two conditions. However, girls spent more money than boys. We are inclined to attribute this effect to the differential attractiveness of the items to the two groups, but it may be a true sex difference. On a test of pricing knowledge, older children scored higher, as did those who got an allowance and those who were better at math, but these last two effects occurred mainly among the younger children. None of the other background variables was related to knowledge of prices. The pattern of results suggests that children who get allowances are more sophisticated about money than those who do not.

The cognitive view of knowledge representation was used as a basic ingredient in understanding how loan officers may not rationally process accounting information. This study presents a path analysis model (covariance model) which describes how loan officers' parallel processing affects their decisions of whether or not to make loans. The results from this study implied that certain decision makers benefited by retrieving more different parallel cues in the first stage and second stage of processing information. The results further imply that users of information generally priorized selected information in order to come to a decision point. It is important to understand decision makers' knowledge representation in the first and second stage of processing in order to explain and predict what types of information are priorized before a final decision is made. Also, if decision makers are aware of their processing biases they may be able to correct and modify their future actions."

These vivid results are not inconsistent with the few extant studies dealing with longevity among creative individuals, although very little by the way of explanation is offered in this limited body of evidence. In this paper a tentative theory is presented, wherein the interaction of work and leisure are seen as impacting on the artists' health and consequent longevity. For the writer, as much and usually more so than other artists, work is seen as providing little immediate pleasure, and often a significant amount of plain. Leisure choices, which are complementary with the writer's work, are not conducive to long life.

The cover story captions of Time magazine for those years were also analysed for rumination. Increased pessimistic ruminations in popular music predicted changes in the American media and public's view of real world events with a one- to two-year lead time. It predicted increased rumination about bad events in Time magazine, and increased pessimism about the economy in nationwide consumer surveys. Using two-stage least squares to solve a system of simultaneous equations, pessimistic rumination in songs and rumination in Time predicted changes in consumer optimism, which in turn predicted personal consumption expenditures and GNP growth. Although pessimistic rumination in songs was an indirect predictor of GNP growth, it may provide early warning of recessions, since its two-year moving average correlated highly (− 0.63) with the moving average of GNP change in the subsequent two years. The implication of recent high levels of pessimistic rumination in songs (in 1989) for a recession are discussed. Collapse"

Theoretical bounds on the moments of a stochastic discount factor are derived as a function of the moments of observed asset -returns. Particular attention is paid to restrictions on moments other than the variance. These bounds can also be used to measure the information about the distribution of the discount factor contained in the moments of various asset returns. As an application of this methodology, bounds on the discount factor are estimated using size-based portfolios, and the results are used to analyze the small firm effect. Empirical results indicate, for the period 1926-1975, that moments of the returns of small firms contain information about the discount factor that is not contained in the moments of the returns of large firms and/or a proxy of the aggregate wealth portfolio. However, this difference disappears when more recent data is included. ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL problems in finance is determining how future revenue streams are discounted to yield the value of an asset. In the absence of arbitrage opportunities, there is a single stochastic discount factor which can be used to value future revenue. This can be seen in the relationship between the price of a security, qt, and the payoff of that security at some Collapse"

Brick and Ravid show that if there exists a tax advantage to debt and nonstochastic interest rates, long-term debt will increase the present value of the tax benefits of debt if the term structure of interest rates, adjusted for risk of default, is increasing. A decreasing term structure, on the other hand, calls for short-term debt. The present paper extends the tax-induced argument of Brick and Ravid to allow for the presence of stochastic interest rates. Once interest rates are uncertain, pricing even under risk neutrality becomes a complex issue. We analyze the debt maturity decision under two competing pricing equations: the return to maturity expectations hypothesis and the local expectations hypothesis. (This terminology is used in Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1981) and Campbell (1986).) Under uncertainty, a debt capacity factor will create an additional incentive to issue long-term debt. Our other results may be interpreted to indicate that if the term premium, the difference between the implied forward interest rate and the future expected spot rate, is positive (sufficiently negative) then long-term (short-term) debt maturity strategy is optimal.

It is established that the time series properties of spot and forward exchange rate data rule out certain econometric specifications used to test the UFRH. Specifically, we find that both spot and forward exchange rates for the U.K., Germany, Japan, and Canada have unit roots and are cointegrated. We also find that the co-integrating parameter in the regression of realized spot on forward rates for each currency is approximately one, implying that researchers who use this specification to test the UFRH may falsely accept the hypothesis simply because of the specification used in the test. Using an alternative error correction specification, we find that the UFRH is resoundingly rejected for all currencies and that the coefficients in this specification exhibit temporal instability. More importantly, we find that the evolution of the estimated parameters is becoming increasingly inconsistent with the UFRH with the passage of time. We conclude the paper with an investigation into potential causes for the gross violation of the UFRH. Collapse"

Empirical evidence appears to indicate that such differences are small for contracts with short maturities. What happens when the futures contract settles to yields implied by future prices of underlying assets? The Eurodollar futures contract, which is the most actively traded futures contract in the United States, settles to yield as opposed to prices. This unique settlement feature is shown to imply that the implied forward prices from the LIBOR term structure should differ from the futures prices even in the absence of marking to market. Differences due to marking to market effect are small: they are shown to vary between 2 to 45 basis points (less than one-half percent of futures prices). On the other hand, differences between implied forward prices and futures prices are shown to be relatively large. Collapse"

Estimates of the determinants of the probability of receiving four major prenatal medical services are obtained, controlling both for socioeconomic status and for initial health status, as inferred from estimates of health technology determining birthweight. Results reject the hypotheses that medical services are provided only on the basis of medical need or are allocated in a market in which the implicit price of care is invariant to husband's income. The combined effect of taxes and transfers is found to reduce the implicit price paid for these four medical services by rich compared to poor married women in the United States, and thus to encourage their use by higher income (and education) groups.

A parametric discrete-state-space version of the consumption-based asset pricing model is solved, calibrated to US data and run. The model is a two-country version of Mehra and Prescott's (1985) economy in which a demand for currency is introduced via cash-in-advance constraints. Forward contracts are priced in this economy, and the statistical properties of forward exchange rates and risk premiums are compared to the observed and implied sample moments for these variables obtained from US data. In addition, the artificial economy is used as a laboratory in which to explore the importance of the convexity term due to stochastic inflation and to study the effects of changes in uncertainty on risk premiums. The principal finding is that with changes in uncertainty consumption risks can produce a forward bias in the observed direction but they cannot account for the dramatic departures from unbiasedness typical of the data.

Nearly one in five new teachers in the district is hired after the start of the school year. Lower-performing schools serving low-income students struggle the most with staffing classrooms on time. Late hiring has serious consequences for student achievement. Students in classrooms with teachers hired after the start of the school year score substantially lower on standardized tests than their peers with other newly hired teachers (0.042 SD in math, 0.037 SD in reading). The effects of having a late-hired middle school math teacher persist beyond a teacher’s first year, evidence of negative selection in the labor market. However, the negative effect of late hiring among elementary teachers and middle school English teachers does not persist, pointing to a temporary disruption effect.

Address correspondence to John Papay (john_papay@brown.edu). DRAFT: PLEASE DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE WITHOUT PERMISSION 1 Missed Opportunities in the Labor Market or Temporary Disruptions? How Late Teacher Hiring Affects Student Achievement Education policymakers and school administrators expend considerable resources trying to staff all schools with effective teachers. Annual spending on teacher salaries and benefits alone approaches $300 billion nationwide (NCES, 2011). In recent years, national attention has focused on increasing the return from these personnel investments by developing policies and practices designed to improve teacher effectiveness and raise student achievement. Efforts to raise teacher quality have taken center stage in the federal Race to the Top competitions, and states and districts have rapidly begun to revamp human resource policies concerning teachers. These strategies make sense because we know that teachers are the most important school-level input to student learning and they vary widely in their ability to raise student test scores (Chetty Friedman, & Rockoff, 2011; McCaffrey, Koretz, Lockwood, & Hamilton, 2004; Rivkin, Hanushek, & Kain, 2005; Rockoff, 2004). Although policymakers have focused heavily on the need to attract, retain, and reward highly effective teachers, they have paid less attention to the processes by which these teachers are hired into schools. Across the country, teacher hiring practices are often inefficient due to policy and capacity constraints that delay hiring. As a result, many school districts still begin the year without a full-time teacher in every classroom. These late hiring practices likely undercut efforts to raise teacher effectiveness and can reduce student achievement in several ways. Most obviously, districts that hire late have a reduced pool of applicants from which to choose. They face what Levin and Quinn (2003) call “missed opportunities” to hire the most qualified candidates in the labor market. This “labor market effect” would mean that the teachers hired late are, on average, less effective than their peers. Furthermore, late hiring can have a temporal DRAFT: PLEASE DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE WITHOUT PERMISSION 2 “disruption effect” on teachers and students. For example, teachers who are hired late may not have sufficient time to prepare for the start of the school year, while their students must deal with instability as classes begin and a transition to a new teacher or classroom. Finally, late hiring can have negative spillover effects on other teachers and students in a school. For example, the lack of a good job match that comes from a delayed and ineffective hiring process can raise teacher turnover, which in turn can reduce student achievement (Ronfeldt et al., 2012). Thus, inefficient and delayed hiring practices can prevent schools from hiring, supporting, and retaining effective teachers. Importantly, the consequences of late teacher hiring are not evenly distributed across the nation’s schools. Because hiring delays are most prevalent in urban districts that serve high proportions of low-income students, the effects of late hiring are concentrated on the very students who have the greatest need for effective teachers. In this paper, we examine the prevalence, distribution, and effects of late teacher hiring in a large urban school district. We find that nearly one in five new teachers is hired after school starts in the fall, and the poorest and lowest-achieving schools struggle the most with staffing all classrooms by the start of the year. We also find that late hiring has serious consequences for student achievement. Students in classrooms with teachers hired after the start of the school year do substantially worse than their peers with other newly hired teachers (0.042 SD in math, 0.037 SD in reading). While we find some evidence of labor market effects, particularly in middle school math, we find strong evidence that late hiring has disruption effects for both teachers and students that suppress achievement. Finally, we find that teachers who are hired late leave their schools, and the district, at much greater rates than their peers who are hired on-time. In the following section, we summarize past research on teacher hiring, focusing on the reasons for late hiring in urban districts and on how hiring practices can affect teachers and DRAFT: PLEASE DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE WITHOUT PERMISSION 3 students. We then describe our data, sample, and methods. Next, we describe the prevalence, characteristics, and distribution of late-hired teachers, and present our findings on achievement effects and retention patterns. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for policymakers seeking to boost teacher quality in urban schools. How Hiring Practices Affect Teachers and Students The hiring process in schools, as in any organization, serves multiple purposes. Most importantly, it is a job matching process in which teachers choose schools and schools choose teachers. Hiring is also the first step in a teacher’s induction to her school, the district, and, for novices, to the profession. Thus, an effective hiring process can help set a teacher up for success by providing them with a good school match, a clear preview of the work required, and the support necessary for a successful transition into a new school (and career). Unfortunately, in many U.S. school districts the hiring process is, as Liu and Johnson (2006) described, “late, rushed, and information-poor.” Late hiring is widespread. In her analysis of the nationally representative Schools and Staffing Survey, Engel (2012) found that 34 percent of teachers hired in 1999-2000 were hired in the second half of summer, and another 11 percent were hired after the school year had begun. The amount of late hiring varies by district, region, school demographics, and labor market conditions. For example, Jones, Maier and Grogan (2011) found that 12 percent of teachers in Michigan between 2003 and 2007 were hired after the school year had begun, while Liu and Johnson (2006) found that as many as one-third of newly hired teachers in California and Florida in 2002 were hired after the start of the school year. Urban districts and those serving large proportions of low-income students struggle the most to fulfill their staffing needs on time. Nationally, urban and low-income districts hire DRAFT: PLEASE DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE WITHOUT PERMISSION 4 almost twice as many teachers after the beginning of the school year compared to their suburban and more affluent counterparts (Engel, 2012). Johnson et al. (2004) documented a 20-percentage point gap in the proportion of teachers hired late between low-income (28 percent) and highincome (8 percent) schools. In Michigan, late-hired teachers were more likely to work in lowerperforming schools and schools that served higher proportions of non-white and low-income students (Jones, Maier and Grogan, 2011). Why do schools hire late? A variety of causes contribute to these persistent late hiring patterns. In a widelyreferenced study from The New Teacher Project on school district hiring practices, Levin and Quinn (2003) categorized the causes of late hiring into two broad domains: (1) human resources department capacity and (2) district staff and budget policies. They explained that, in many districts, human resources departments do not have clear and strategic hiring goals, have insufficient systems to project vacancies and track applicants, and offer candidates poor customer service and communication. District policies also contribute to hiring delays, as many districts permit teachers to notify their schools late in the spring if they plan to leave or transfer schools and give transferring teachers first priority to choose a position before a search can be opened to the external candidate pool. Similarly, teachers are often allowed to announce their retirements after the end of the school year, leaving districts scrambling to find a replacement. Levin and Quinn blamed collective bargaining agreements for these challenges, although districts in states that prohibit bargaining, such as the one we describe in this study, also struggle to hire teachers on time for similar reasons. Finally, they noted that many districts face delays in hiring because school budgets are beholden to political processes at the state and local levels, which are often very slow.

112005,1991,journal of labor research,the changing character of employee relations,the changing character of employee relations,"Wisconsin is one of several states in the Great Lakes region specializing in a variety of cash crops that historically require great influxes of migratory labor for brief periods of cultivation, harvesting, and processing. Successful organizing of migrant pickle workers by Jesus Salas in 1967 led to the certification of his union, Obreros Unidos United Workers, as the workers exclusive bargaining representative. Despite the successful organizing efforts however, the end result of the collective bargaining efforts was the elimination of bargaining unit employee jobs by mechanical harvesting before a contract was ever signed. The theoretical frame of reference developed by Craypo (1986) is used to explain the union's organizing success and failed collective bargaining. The model shows that the sources of union bargaining strength were established initially, but because of the changing bargaining environment they were not maintained long enough to successfully negotiate a single contract. The shirking of farm-worker collective bargaining occurred through changes in the company's organizational structure, technology, and the policy of the state's legal apparatus. All combined to erode the union's bargaining power and caused the union's eventual demise, The analysis also shows that agricultural production via contract farming is a significant determinant of migrant field labor collective bargaining structures and outcomes. SUCCESS IN ORGANIZING, FAILURE IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING: THE CASE OF PICKLE WORKERS IN WISCONSIN, 1967-68 1 by Rene Perez Rosenbaum 2 This paper makes several contributions to the agricultural labor relations literature. First, the paper fills a gap in the history of agricultural labor relations. In the only article that documents the unionizing events in the mid 1960S of pickle workers in Wisconsin (""Obreros Unidos,"" 1968), Mark Erenburg tells only part of the story. His article, written before the union's negotiations with the migrants' employer were complete, does not give a full account of what happened. It tells the success story of the union in its ability to organize the workers and to win it's representation election. Not told, however, is the story of the elimination of bargaining employee jobs by mechanical harvesting before a bargaining contract was ever signed. This paper adds to the literature by telling the rest of the story. 1 A draft of this paper was first presented at The Julian Samora Research Institute Colloquia Series on May 22, 1991. 2 About the Author: Dr. Rosenbaum has a Ph.D. in Economics and is a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Julian Samora Research Institute. His ongoing research while at the Institute is in Latino economic issues, including the unionization and coIlective bargaining of Latino workers; the economics of Latino businesses; and the international commuter worker phenomenon as an economic feature of the U.S. border economy. The article also fills a great lacuna in the agricultural labor relations literature—its inattention to questions about field labor collective bargaining. Except for a sparse treatment of collective bargaining, mostly in California agriculture (Koziara, 1980; Martin, 1988), an analysis of the ultimate sources of agricultural union bargaining strength is notably absent. In large measure, the labor relations problem in agriculture has been perceived in terms of worker organizations and union recognition rather than in terms of collective bargaining (Coronado, 1980; Glass, 1966; Morin, 1952; Taylor, 1976). This article redresses the imbalance in the agricultural labor relations literature by talking to this labor relations problem from a collective bargaining rather than an organizingunionizing point of view. The focus goes beyond the important issue of worker organization and considers other factors relevant to collective bargaining after union recognition. This article also applies and extends to agriculture a theoretical frame of reference previously used to analyze union bargaining power in other industries, where unions, strikes, and collective bargaining have been much more significant. Charles Craypo (1986) presented an institutional model of comparative unionmanagement bargaining power that in only one case (see Rosenbaum, 1991) has been applied to agriculture. In adopting Craypo's bargaining framework to this 3 The focus on organization-unionization vs. collective bargaining is understandable. This is most likely due to the historic inability of farm labor unions to win recognition and the present lack of collective bargaining agreements in agriculture outside California and Hawaii. field labor relations case, we draw on the labor relations experience in the industrial and service sectors and relate to this case the collective bargaining lessons learned in these more unionized sectors of the economy. Extending Craypo's model to agriculture also enables us to test the model in terms of its its ability to explain the agricultural union's failed collective bargaining outcomes and its apparently weak bargaining strength. The final contribution, stemming out of the theoretical frame of reference, is the findings and analysis of this labor relations case. Craypo's theoretical frame of reference provides an adequate explanation of what happened in this collective bargaining case. In examining Obreros Unidos' collective bargaining experience, an important determinant of both the collective bargaining structure and outcomes was identified. The analysis demonstrates that farming contracts, which vertically coordinate different stages of agricultural production, are important factor in field labor relations. This finding is particularly important in light of the prevalence of contract farming in vegetable production currently employing migrant agricultural workers. Presented first is a brief summary of the organization, recognition, and negotiations of Obreros Unidos in 1967. Next is a presentation on the Wisconsin Employment relations Commission (WERC), and its findings and policy decisions in the unfair labor practice charges filed against the employer by the union. A discussion on the relationship between contract farming and bargaining structures is next, followed by an analysis of the relationship between bargaining structures in agricultural labor relations and collective bargaining outcomes. The paper's conclusion discusses (l) the ability of Craypo's theoretical frame of reference to explain the outcomes in this labor relations case and (2) the potential implications of contract farming on field worker labor relations. Organization, Recognition, and Negotiations Obreros Unidos (United Workers) in Wisconsin, 1967 U. S. citizens of Mexican origin, mostly from South Texas, have migrated to jobs in Wisconsin vegetable cultivation, harvesting, and processing since WW II. In the mid-1960s, the state employed an average of 10,000 migrant farm workers. In October 1966, Jesus Salas attempted to organize 100 migrants employed in a potato processing operation. Obreros Unidos was formed but its attempt to gain union recognition failed after an 8-day strike. The following summer, however, the union was successful in organizing 650 pickle harvest workers (Erenburg, 1968). The union’s attempt to organize pickle harvest workers in 1967 was directed against Libby, the employer, or the company), who had contracted with several growers for the crop. On August 18, 1967, when Libby was advised of the union’s existence and presented with a demand for recognition, the company refused, claiming it wasn’t the field-workers’ employer. This triggered a walkout of 80 percent of the workers in Libby contracted fields (Erenburg, 1968). Obreros Unidos then requested WERC to conduct a representation election among ""all harvesting employees of Libby, McNeill & Libby working in Marquette, Portage, Waushara and Green Lake counties, Wisconsin ... (Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, 1967, p.l). The emergency situation compelled WERC to conduct an expedited hearing that resulted in an order to direct a representative election. The election, held on August 31, 1967, resulted in an overwhelming majority of field workers in favor of Obreros Unidos as their bargaining agent (Erenburg, 19683. On September 8, 1967, the commission certified Obreros Unidos as the exclusive bargaining agent for the harvest workers (Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, 1968). Negotiations with respect to wages, hours and working conditions of harvest workers commenced at the close of the 1967 harvest season. At a meeting September 26, 1967, Libby advised Obreros Unidos representativesXthat the company was reviewing its cucumber operations because of insufficient profitability. In the fifth negotiation meeting held November 16, 1967, the company delivered the following letter to the union: You will recall during our previous meetings, it was indicated to your negotiating committee that Libby's decision relative to its cucumber program had not been finalized. We wish at this time to advise you that by reason of our 1967 experimentation with mechanical harvesting a decision had now been made to continue our cucumber program, but that all harvesting aspects will be handled mechanically starting the 1968 season. Therefore, we will not require the services of migrant agricultural workers to perform field harvesting operations in cucumbers. Furthermore, since we will have no migrant agricultural workers in cucumbers, we will have no need for migrant housing in the district. We, therefore, are disposing of our interest in such facilities. The bargaining unit concept as developed in the hearing before the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board was confined to conditions as they actually were at the time of the hearing. The character of the unit was firmly established as migrant agricultural workers. > By reason of the above, continued labor negotiations would appear to be superfluous, and we are Collapse"

Histoire & Mesure, 2011, XXVI-1 52 The relationship between population and subsistence in preindustrial societies has been subjected to two types of research. On the one hand, a traditional historiography has dealt with the study of the nature and dynamics of subsistence crisis, especially the relationship between famine and mortality . This argument has been reviewed recently based on the study of contemporary famine 2. On the other hand, the relationships between demographic variables and prices in the long term have been studied. The objective was to elucidate which factors attenuated historical price volatility, luctuations in production and the demographic crisis associated with them, especially the crisis of mortality related to famine. These studies have established that the regularity of harvests, decrease in the intensity of luctuations in prices and the easing of demographic luctuations are strong indicators of economic development and social welfare in preindustrial societies 3. The literature on changes of behavioural demographic variables to commodity price luctuations is abundant. In general the studies show a high inversed correlation between baptisms (births or conceptions) with prices. This inverse relationship between fertility and prices was explained on the basis of biological (amenorrhea, increase in diseases related to malnutrition) and social factors (various forms of fertility control), or a combination of both. However, it was impossible to establish to what extent each of these factors helps in explaining the phenomenon. This inverse relationship has also been well established between prices and nuptiality, however the behaviour of nuptiality presents more pronounced differences between regions and countries than those registered in the behaviour of birth. While the crises of subsistence keep discouraging any conclusion of new marriages after poor harvests, the behaviour might be more complex when the famine coincided with mortality. The response of marriage above death could be more complex: the irst response could result in a postponement of marriages, but with one or two years of delay, marriages could be increased with the rebuilding of previously destroyed homes. The relationship between famine and increased mortality is not as evident as in conceptions and marriages. It is dificult to separate deaths directly caused by hunger and those induced by the spread of disease in populations weak1.

The analysis of historical data has shown a positive correlation, albeit low, between increases in prices, and mortality in many regions, and an increasing weakening of these relations from the middle of the eighteenth century 4. The subject of our communication links with the latter general observations. The question that I will try to answer is whether the economic transformations that occurred in the seventeenth century in the Majorcan Island led to an attenuation of the luctuations in prices and food production, and a lower frequency and intensity of crises of subsistence . This communication has been structured in the following sections: the irst section describes the sources and methods used to study the relationships between demographic and economic variables; in the second section the timing and sub-periods of the economic and demographic changes that took place between 1570 and 1660 are established, and the sub-periods from which our analysis will be structured, after which we will study the relationship between prices, yields and demographic variables and inally it is completed with some general observations. 1. The space, the data and the methods Until recent times most of the historiography on the island of Majorca has argued that the frequency and intensity of famines from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century was the result of backwardness agriculture, and that policies intended to mitigate its effects (import of grains, the taxation of price, distribution of wheat, etc.) caused huge losses to the public inances of the kingdom and jeopardized their economic growth 6. However, recent studies on the demographics and economy of the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries present a different scenario. Firstly, the demography studies have argued an early decrease in infant mortality rates and a reduction in the intensity of the demographic crisis throughout the eighteenth century 7. Moreover, studies on economy have showed some changes in agrarian and commercial sectors in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. On the one hand, the crisis in the manufacture of wool exports; and on the other hand 4.

These studies have contradicted the alleged « unchanged » early modern Majorcan economy and to relate agricultural changes to the demographic ones 8. The aim of this communication is to conduct an initial exploration of the origins of these changes from the analysis of the relationship between demographic variables, prices and the production of food. To analyze the relations between population and subsistence at this stage the series of parish registers of births, marriages and deaths, cereal prices in the city of Palma and the series of cereal production will be used. The crops series comes from the records of the cereal harvests collected by the authorities of the island since the Middle Ages. These records estimated the harvest of cereals and pulses with a multipurpose, irst to gather the information necessary to prevent possible shortages, the other was used to set the starting price at auction for the lease of the tithes and other taxes on production 9. The prices of cereals came from the mercurial of de Palma 10. The city prices were affected by several factors. First, for the urban demand which was more inelastic than the rural one; second for the cost of transporting grain from the villages to the city, third for the role of wheat imports and inally for the political economic of authorities . We do not know what differences there were between city and rural prices or how the city prices inluenced rural ones. However, city prices are a reference for the entire island 12. Because, the city was the largest market and main manufacturing center of the island where the bulk of agrarian rents and surplus for urban consumption and export converged 13. The construction of a homogeneous sample representative of the demographic variables (births, marriages and deaths) for the period studied has raised some problems. Our initial aim was to make a single homogeneous sample, representative of different agro-ecological districts of the island. Despite the la Collapse"

The exception is further consolidation of national unions through mergers and affiliations which will change the makeup and increase the effectiveness of the unions involved.It behooves us all who love freedom and democracy to do what we can to assure strong and viable unions in America. We in the labor movement do not believe that we can have a free society and a high standard of living without free and effective unions. In this regard, I conclude with a statement made in 1945 by my first boss, Philip Murray, president of the United Steelworkers of America and the Congress of Industrial Organizations: “American democracy cannot survive in an atmosphere of insecurity, joblessness, and poverty. When people are at work at high wages, prosperity is continuous. To return to an era of low wages is to invite unemployment and catastrophe from which no segment of the population, no matter how apparently secure, will escape. We dare not allow mass misery and unemployment to overtake us again.” Collapse"

112011,1991,journal of labor research,unionism in the public sector:  comment,unionism in the public sector comment,"Abstract We review four current challenges facing organization labor; the changing nature of work; the emergence of a new model of Human Resource Management; the changing composition of the labor force and political/legislative challenges. Based on psychological models of unionization (Barling, Fullagar, & Kelloway, 1992) and current research on the determinants of unionization, we predict that unions will survive as vital organizations to the extent that they are able to ensure their instrumentality for members and potential members. The need to enhance the public image of unions is also indicated.What can unions do? ... unionism is not only 'dead' but 'obsolete' in the new, post-industrial, service-sector economy... Every thoughtful observer...seems to agree...that organized labor is through and history has passed it by. (Geoghegan, 1991, p. 42).These views are depressingly and maddenly familiar to labour organizations and those interested in their welfare. Through the 1980s and 1990s observers have increasingly pointed to the decline, and perhaps imminent demise, of the labour movement. That the labour movement is facing considerable challenge is beyond question. However, the conclusion that unions will not survive these challenges is by no means certain. Perhaps this uncertainty is best illustrated by the observation that Geoghegan's (1991) comments given above are summarizing the American labour movement of the 1920s rather than that of the 1990s.While it would be rash to conclude that unions are now obsolete, it would be equally rash to predict a resurgence of interest in unionization such as occurred in the 1940s in North America. Our goals in this paper are more limited. First, we outline some of the challenges currently facing organized labour. Second, we draw on models of unionization (e.g., Barling, Fullagar, & Kelloway, 1992) to outline potential responses to these challenges. In doing so, we place our emphasis on the contributions of psychological research to outlining strategies for unions.Current challengesThe labour movement is facing challenges on virtually all fronts. Hartley (1995), for example, identifies challenges in the economic, political and social spheres facing trade unions in the United Kingdom. We identify four major challenges facing unions today. First, the changing nature of work and, in particular, the way work is organized has profound implications for organized labour. Second, the emergence of a new model of human resources management has substantially changed the nature of union-management relations. Third, the changing demographics of the Canadian labour force have been particularly pronounced in the labour movement (Galarneau, 1996). Finally, political and legislative actions have had an impact on organized labour.The Changing Nature of WorkPerhaps the single greatest change over the last decade has been the global restructuring of production (Hartley, 1995). The switch from a manufacturing-based to a service-based economy (or from a ""Fordist"" to a ""Post-Fordist system of production; Clegg, 1990), and the reduction in international trade barriers with the resultant globalization of the world economy (i.e., the emergence of the European market, the North American Free Trade Agreement, Reitsma, 1993), all pose significant challenges the labour movement.The shift of work from the goods sector to the service sector is clearly reflected in union density figures. Indeed some observers attribute the stagnation and/or decline of union density to this shift (e.g., Galarneau, 1996). For example, union density in the goods sector had declined to 37.6% in 1992 (from 43.4% in 1976). Approximately 67% of all jobs lost during the most recent recession are attributed to plant closings (Pupo & White, 1994). Correspondingly, union density in the service sector increased from 25. … Collapse"

Moreover, throughout the first half of the nineteenth century the rights of squatters increased and, perhaps, culminated in 1862 with the right to settle on all unsurveyed land. If the state was interested in mitigating policing costs on the frontier, it seems inconsistent to allow squatters to forge ahead and settle on the locations of their choice. These scattered farmers caused frictions with Indians that interfered with the treaty process and would appear to have forced the troops to spread too thinly in their patrols.59 The first preemption act was passed in 1830 and required continual renewal by Congress. The most notable feature was that squatters only had preemptive rights on surveyed land. Even the Preemptive Act of 1841 required that the land be surveyed. As long as the land required a survey, preemption is consistent with the hypothesis of settlement used to mitigate state enforcement costs. Surveys restricted the areas that were open to settlement, and, if anyone settled on unsurveyed land, then the state had no obligation to protect them. The rise of preemption, then, was simply a precursor to the homestead movement. The state was encouraging settlement in areas where it wanted a better definition of property rights over land. The problem with preemption is its applicability to unsurveyed lands. Once the federal government allowed squatting, it became obliged to protect the squatter, and, although squatters had private incentives to avoid clashes with Indians, since they used the government's threat of 59 The evidence is mixed on the government's record of defending squatters. Squatters were assisted by the army, but it appears the army did not go out of its way to do so. 19 THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS violence free of charge, the probability of disputes was higher than had they made completely private decisions. I conjecture that preemption was allowed because of the rising cost of surveys in Indian territory. Surveys were most useful when done ahead of settlement, and the first surveyors must have experienced countless natural dangers. However, surveying in a war zone would be next to impossible. Clawson quotes the following from some 1854 surveyor field reports:60 On arriving in the field we found our work was immediately in the vicinity of headquarters of the hostile Indians and after skirmishing with us 2 days, they fired the prairies, completely demolishing everything for our cattle to subsist on for many miles, in fact the whole country lying between the Solomon and Republic Rivers, and we were forced to abandon our work. It is my duty to inform you that Messrs. Armstrong and McClure, deputy surveyors, have arrived at Leavenworth bearing the information that while they were running the line of surveys their camp was attacked by a band of hostile Indians. They report that one of their assistants, A. H. Morgan by name, was instantly killed and that the Indians destroyed their wagons, tents, provisions, etc. At this place a party of Indians fired on me and my men. Their design was to kill us; they had previously threatened to shoot me and my men if I did not quit surveying there. A shell struck a tree against which I was leaning at the time, while my compass needle was sitting not 6 inches from me. Dick states that, ""[o]n August 19, 1871, E. C. Cunningham, the surveyor general for the Nebraska area, wrote to a member of Congress that except for the summer of 1870 there had not been a single season since 1863 during which the government surveyor had been allowed to do his work unmolested.""61 The problems of harassment were, not so much in the loss of surveyors, but the fraud it encouraged. Dick reports massive amounts of graft and poor quality work done by surveyors on the edge of the frontier.62 Some lines were later found to be over five miles off, spans of up to thirty miles showed no signs of survey, and many settlers found themselves with homesteads of less than 100 acres. Preemption on unsurveyed lands, then, could be explained by the rise in the cost of survey. With no reliable survey, homesteading in very hostile areas could not be carried out, and preemption may have been a viable alternative to 60 Clawson, supra note 16, at 56-57. 61 Dick, supra note 54, at 26. 62 Id. at 27-36.

Because such investments have a higher value in their intended than in their next best use, parties have an incentive to engage in haggling or other forms of opportunism in hopes of influencing the distribution of the resulting quasi rents. Contracts promote efficiency by securing the distribution of those rents ex ante, thereby avoiding costly repetitive bargaining over the terms of trade and reducing the risk for each party of relying on the performance of the other.

Under existing U.S. trade law, however, there is little doubt that Japanese producers were formally guilty of dumping during the period under investigation-that is, selling at a price below their current unit costs of production. Reconciliation of these seemingly contradictory conclusions lies in the recognition that Japanese (and American) semiconductor firms make their Collapse"

However, dissemination of computer-based records has been slow and fraught with logistical complications. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recently undertook an 18-month study to examine the status of patient records and of computer-based approaches to their management. The study examined current and future users and uses of patient records plus technologies to support record automation. Strategies were then developed to address the barriers to widespread adoption of computerbased records. Solutions depend on a coordinated national, regional, and institutional approach to computing and communications infrastructure. Physicians may wish to familiarize themselves with the final report, in which the IOM has recommended that the public and private sectors join in establishing a Computer-Based Patient Record Institute to promote and facilitate development, implementation, and dissemination of computer-based records. Patient Records and Computers Among the diverse strategies for coping with the cost and inefficiency of our health-care system, improvement in clinical information-management systems is frequently cited (1,2). Any clinician can testify to the wasted time and poor communication among providers that can arise because of antiquated paper records that still predominate in our offices and on the hospital wards. Problems with the paper record recur on an almost daily basis. Mr. Jones arrives in the office for a consultation, but the outside records have not arrived. Mrs. Smith was discharged from the hospital last week and returns for a followup appointment, but the inpatient chart and discharge summary are not available or cannot be located. Equally exasperating is the time required to find information in the chart. Illegible handwriting, missing reports, and pages filed out of chronological order all conspire against the best intentions of providers hoping to find relevant clinical information. Furthermore, while one physician has the chart in the clinic, it is unavailable to other clinical, billing, or qualityassurance groups who may also need access to the information that it contains. Such access to longitudinal patient information is especially important for an aging, mobile society in which chronic diseases increasingly predominate as the focus of ongoing care. Challenges to our approaches to medical-record keeping are not a recent phenomenon. Weed's influential problem-oriented record is now almost 25-years old (3), and critiques of the medical chart occur frequently in the clinical literature (4-7). However, a ""general air of guiltless acceptance of the inadequacy of the records"" is a common attitude (8). Computerbased experiments in medical-record storage and management date back to the 1960s, but despite several successful systems (1,2,9), dissemination of such methods has been slow and fraught with logistical complications. The technologies often transfer only with difficulty from one institution to another, and incompatibility between computer-based records and other clinical or administrative information systems is a common complaint. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) is concerned about the slow adoption of technological solutions to the problems of paper records, and is convinced that the nation's medical records are contributing to our current health-care crisis (10). The organization therefore recently undertook an 18-month study to examine the status of patient records and of computer-based approaches to their management (11). The Committee on Improving the Patient Record sought to identify the various users and uses of the patient record, to survey the role and emerging capability of computers to support those uses, to identify the barriers to more widespread adoption of patient-record systems, and to recommend strategies for overcoming those barriers. Primary users of the medical record (those who care directly for patients) often forget (or disregard) the other legitimate users of patient records who depend on accurate, complete, and accessible information. Secondary users include insurers, regulatory agencies, clinical researchers, hospital administrators, epidemiologists, and numerous other health-industry professionals who have a vested interest in the quality of the record and in the efficiency with which it can be accessed and shared. Although there are serious and justifiable concerns regarding the confidentiality and security of patient information in computer-based records, mechanisms to safeguard such information, or to strip patient identifiers from pooled data, exist and can be mandated to reduce breaks in security and to allay concerns about inappropriate access to private medical information. Physicians have vast unmet but well-documented information-access needs that plague them while they care for patients (12,13). Many of these needs could be effectively addressed by computers. Expecting physicians to use computers routinely, however, is only reasonable if systems provide a critical mass of capabilities which efficiently serve the needs of clinicians (14). Networked workstations, for example, could be used not only to retrieve patient records, but also to provide integrated access to the medical literature (for example, MEDLINE in its many forms) and to provide decision-support capabilities (for example, diagnostic tools, therapy advisory systems, and programs for browsing specialized clinical knowledge bases) (15). The user interface plays an important role in the acceptance of computers by physicians. The popularity of personal computers grew with the advent of graphical interfaces and a single metaphor (such as the Apple MacintoshTM ""desktop"" with pictures corresponding to folders or file cabinets), and physicians are clearly demanding non-keyboard methods for interacting with computers. Recently announced pen-based computers (clipboard-sized devices that interpret handwritten characters as the user ""writes"" on a display screen) are likely to complement mouse-style interfaces in the near future, and ongoing research on speech understanding holds great promise as well (16). With greatly improved interfaces already available, however, information systems must be introduced to help practicing physicians access and manage clinical information more effectively. In addition to their role in enhancing patient care, electronic patient records will facilitate clinical research. Consider, for example, the nation's current high-priority efforts to improve our assessment of clinical outcomes and to develop valid management guidelines (17). Until computer-based record keeping is the norm, gathering pooled outcomes data for common disorders such as prostatic hypertrophy, cataracts, and degenerative hip disease (three areas of recent close scrutiny) will depend on labor-intensive, error-prone, manual data abstraction and reentry (18). Even more problematic is the dissemination of guidelines back to the primary providers of care. Current plans depend almost entirely on publication of guidelines, despite the recognized inability of clinicians adequately to read and absorb the relevant clinical literature. Suppose, instead, that panels of clinicians, using computer-based records interconnected through national networks, provided routine real-time collection and pooling of outcomes data as an automated byproduct of the patient-care process. Not only would the pertinent outcomes data and care decisions be gathered automatically, but the same computer systems could provide a mechanism for delivering established guidelines back to the point of care when they are needed. By analogy, this approach could be extended to other forms of clinical research, including multi-institutional trials and studies by the pharmaceutical industry. Such strategies also hold great promise to reduce the time currently spent by clinicians on administrative details related to the patient record and to the organization of information stored within it. The obvious appeal of using computer-based techniques to solve both local and national issues in clinical data management motivated the IOM committee to seek methods to catalyze change. The committee's vision of the future is possible with current technology, but it depends on a coordinated national, regional, and institutional approach to computing and communications infrastructure for the biomedical community. The IOM committee, acknowledging that there is no national organization with a current mandate to oversee and coordinate the logistical issues involved in defining the infrastructure for computer-based patient records, has recommended that the public and private sectors join in establishing a Computer-Based Patient Record Institute to promote and facilitate the development, implementation, and dissemination of such records (11). Combined with an unequivocal call for the adoption of computer-based records on a national basis, the IOM recommendations cite the need for improved standards for connecting machines to one another and for sharing data. Such standards will help assure that vendors and other system developers provide compatible systems that can share information across institutions. Although the IOM's published report and detailed recommendations did not appear until early autumn (11), a coalition of public and private organizations has already spent the summer gathering support for the creation of such an institute (19). Its success will be highly dependent upon a broad base of participating professional, governmental, commercial, and patient-advocate organizations. Making informed patient-care decisions depends on timely access to and management of patient information. Gaining this access is intimately tied to the development of a national biomedical information-management infrastructure. Thus, th Collapse"

In order to avoid the high cost of formal, extensive, and systematic investigations, legislators use reauthorization hearings and personal exchanges with administrators as opportunities for oversight (Ogul). To further reduce the cost of oversight, legislators have developed a system of ""fire-alarm oversight"" in which interest groups and constituents monitor administrators and inform Congress of improper, inappropriate, or unsatisfactory decisions. Legislators then become involved only after their monitors have identified some problem or transgression. This system thus supplies legislators with the information required to maintain control over the bureaucracy without having to undertake systematic surveillance themselves (McCubbins and Schwartz).

To illustrate this influence, they compare the operation of the gold standard with the post-gold standard regime in the United States. They find that nominal short-term interest rates were mean-reverting before 1914, but became nonstationary after the creation of the Federal Reserve System. We extend Mankiw, Miron, and Weil's analysis by noting that the period from 1914 to the present cannot be characterized as one uninterrupted episode of policy discretion. The United States temporarily abandoned discretion for a rule in the 1940s. The Fed and Treasury agreed in April 1942 that the Fed would adjust Federal Reserve credit in a manner that would produce relatively low market rates on longterm securities. In particular, the Fed committed itself to support twenty-year government bond prices at a level consistent with a 2.5 percent interest rate ceiling. We investigate the possibility that the bond price support program of the 1940s conditioned the behavior of short-term interest rates in a predictable way. According to the expectation theory of the term structure, a binding long-term interest rate ceiling implies that an increase in the current short rate must cause the sum of the innovation and the change in future expected rates to be zero. Otherwise, the long rate rises above the ceiling and the public perceives a violation of the bond rate commitment. Placing a binding ceiling on long-term interest rates tends to make short-term interest rates mean-reverting. Collapse"

112125,1991,journal of policy modeling,a competitive model of the japanese firm,a competitive model of the japanese firm,"Abstract * Porter's home-base diamond model of international competitiveness is seriously flawed when applied to a small, open, trading economy like Canada's. * Porter's framework needs to be adapted to explain Canada's successful resource-based multinationals, foreign subsidiaries and access to the triad market of the United States through the Free Trade Agreement. A new ""double diamond"" framework is developed to achieve this. Key words * Porter's single diamond model works for large triad economies but needs to be adapted for smaller countries like Canada. Introduction The influential Porter (1990) study on the determinants of international competitiveness suggests that the home country ""diamond"" is the source of competitive advantage for domestic firms. The competitive advantage of a firm depends upon one, or more, of the four key determinants of the nation's international competitiveness. The successful domestic firms build upon this home base and can then export or engage in outward foreign direct investment. In short, Porter's model states that a global firm needs to have a sustainable competitive advantage based on the successful utilization of components of its home country diamond. The thesis of this article is that Porter's diamond framework explains the success of U.S., Japanese and E.C.-based multinationals, i.e. the triad. However, Porter's model is not applicable to small, open, trading economies which are not parts of this triad. For example, Rugrnan and D'Cruz (1991) have demonstrated that Canada's international competitiveness is not explained by the Porter home country diamond. They show that substantial modifications of the Porter framework are required to analyze the nature of Canada's foreign-owned firms and institutional arrangements, such as the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. The latter arrangement suggest that the Canadian diamond need to be considered jointly with the U.S. diamond, i.e. that the Canadian managers needs to operate in this ""double diamond"" framework. Indeed, Rugman and D'Cruz propose that a ""North American diamond"" be used by Canadian managers and policy makers-in searching for useful answers to the question of how to improve Canada's international competitiveness. A similar insight emerges from the work of Cartwright (1991) in his assessment of the application of the Porter model in the New Zealand study. A team headed by Porter used the Porter single diamond theory as a benchmark for a study of the international competitiveness of New Zealand, see Crocombe, Enright and Porter (1991). In his critique, Cartwright demonstrates, using empirical judgemental impact scores, that a ""double diamond"" framework has much greater explanatory power in a New Zealand context than does Porter's home country diamond model Cartwright concludes that his results ""cast serious doubt on the ability of the Porter diamond theory to account satisfactorily for the international competitiveness of land-based industries that must export a high proportion of their production"" (Cartwright 1991, p. 7). In a related, but independent, development Cho (1991) has also adapted the Porter diamond in order to better explain the role of inward foreign direct investment into Korea. Cho extends Porter's six factor model into a nine factor model and tests it to explain Japanese FDI (that by Japanese sogo-shoshas) in Korea, in relation to the performance of Japanese sogo-Shoshas in Korea, whereas the methodology of Porter (1990) would require the use of the Japanese diamond, not the Korean. How, then, Should Porter's model be modified to explain the international competitiveness of small, open, trading nations such as Canada, New Zealand, and Korea? Here it is demonstrated that each country needs to set its own home-country diamond against the relevant ""triad"" diamond. In general, most Asia-Pacific nations will set theirs against Japan's. … Collapse"
112128,1991,journal of policy modeling,the short-term macroeconomic effects of price controls,the short term macroeconomic effects of price controls,"Abstract A simple general equilibrium model is constructed to analyze the effects of price controls on income distribution, output, and the budget deficit. The economy is partitioned into private and public sectors. In the former sectors prices are competitively determined, while in the latter they are set exogenously by government decree. Furthermore, public sector prices might differ for producers and consumers. The analysis is conducted in the context of an open economy with a fixed exchange rate where foreign goods are imperfect substitutes for domestic goods in consumption. Thus, the spillover of price controls into the trade balance is incorporated into the model. The taxes/subsidies imposed on various groups by price controls are identified. An equilibrium is constructed for an economy producting 10 goods, of which 4 are affected by price controls. Simulations are performed to analyze the effects of an exchange rate devaluation on the main macroeconomic indicators. Collapse"

112131,1991,journal of policy modeling,inflationary impact of money-financed deficits,inflationary impact of money financed deficits,"Abstract Inflationary financing is relied upon especially at times of unexpected fiscal pressure. Thus, rather than being a fairly constant share of GNP, the deficit to be financed by money creation is prone to significant variation. This note examines the impact of transitory changes in the level of deficit to be financed. Three types of shock are studied: first, a one-period transitory shock; second, a moving average transitory shock; and third, a permanent change in the money-financed deficit. It is shown that an increase in the deficit to be financed will result in a more than proportionate increase in the rate of inflation whilr it is being financed. This magnification effect is greater the higher the initial fiscal deficit, the lower the propensity to hold money, the more sensitive the demand for money to the rate of inflation and the longer the duration of shock. The response of inflation involves an initial surge followed by a backwash: inflation in the first period of the shock is higher than subsequently. The loss imposed on holders of money is higher than the deficit that is financed to an extent greater than the familiar deadweight loss arising from agents economizing on their cash balances because of anticipated inflation.

Therefore it is not necessarily true that a decline of technical progress growth has been at the root of this labor productivity slowdown. An impulse analysis shows that these conclusions depend on a number of crucial assumptions and parameter values of the vintage model. The influence of real wage costs on scrapping of old capital goods appears to be of major importance in this respect. The same holds for the question whether technical progress is endogenous.

Growth is not reduced by a stipulated income redistribution policy. The second type of environment is “open,” with structural transformation oriented towards maximal welfare growth. This case gives rise to the fastest growth; output and export patterns vary in favor of the dynamically most efficient activities. When confronted with frictions or restrictions, “openness” no longer leads to the most rapid growth, and the resulting changes in output and trade patterns are limited. Collapse"
112143,1991,journal of policy modeling,economic impact and transition effects,economic impact and transition effects,Abstract A dynamic model of Canada-United States trade is used to simulate the transition effects of the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement. The model simulations suggest that Canadian real GDP would increase by about four percentage points over a 10 year horizon. The results are shown to be sensitive to assumptions regarding the possibility of U.S. protectionism in the “base case” and the tariff equivalent of the dispute settlement mechanism contained in the Agreement.

112144,1991,journal of policy modeling,macroeconomic effects and sensitivity analysis,macroeconomic effects and sensitivity analysis,"Abstract The University of Toronto's FOCUS model of the Canadian economy is used to examine the economic implications of the Free Trade Agreement with the United States. Drawing upon the results of the companion article by Richard Harris, the model depicts the impact of the agreement on output, incomes, employment, prices, and the exchange rate through the next 12 years. Alternative experiments test the sensitivity of the results to the wide range of the assumptions about policy and economic behavior that must be made to conduct a meaningful study of the agreement. Our best estimate of the aggregate economic impact of the agreement is an increase in the real rate of growth of 0.4 percent per year over the 10-year transition period. There will be downward pressures on the price level, especially towards the end of the century, and temporary improvements in the unemployment rate. There are significant permanent gains in incomes. Although near-term pressures on the current account could weaken the Canadian dollar, over the longer term the agreement should clearly strengthen the dollar. These results are insensitive to reasonable variations in almost all the necessary assumptions. The results are, however, highly sensitive to the estimates of improvements in productivity growth obtained by Harris and other researchers. If Canada does not achieve reasonably secure access to the large U.S. market during the transition period, or if Canadian industry is currently relatively more efficient and “world scale” than is estimated, then the productivity gains could be quite modest, and the economic benefits of the agreement would be reduced, but not eliminated.

The main purpose of this article is to provide an economic rationale for this widespread practice. It is assumed that there is an asymmetry of information between the insurers and insureds, where the latter know better their probability of death, and hence adverse selection may cause a market failure. To overcome this problem, a multiperiod (for exposition purposes a three-period model is used) contract and a single-period contract are offered. The multiperiod contract specifies a savings element which may be received by the insured at his or her discretion if the insured lives at the end of the second period. lt is shown that by the right choice of the savings element and the return on this element, the insurers can induce insureds to self select. Insureds with lower probabilities of death will choose the multiperiod conitract whereas insureds with higher mortality rates will choose successive single-period contracts. It is therefore shown that tie-in arrangements of savings and insurance may help solve the problem of adverse selection and hence an economic rationale is provided for their existence. Cash-value life insurance contracts tie savings and risk of death insurance. Many researchers tried to explain the popularity of such tie-in arrangements, and whether they can dominate a strategy of buying risk insurance (i.e., term insurance) and savings separately (see, e.g., Ferrari, 1968; Fortune, 1973; Collapse"

Van Gorkom was decided in the Supreme Court of Delaware in 1985 and shortly thereafter began to receive considerable attention in legal and business communities and in journals of scholarship. The claim has been made that the case was a landmark decision which will cause nominees to refuse to serve on corporate boards, increase the difficulty of obtaining Director's and Officer's Liability (D&O) insurance, and provide a boon for investment bankers and outside consultants. This article provides a brief overview of the facts in the case and discusses the Court of Chancery and Delaware Supreme Court decisions, and the theory of liability which is central to the case. The effects which some commentators predicted would result from the decision are analyzed, and some of these conjectures are disputed. A positive result of the Van Gorkomn case - the enactment of Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware Code and similar state statutes - is identified. The Van Gorkom decision will have an impact primarily because it inspired the enactment of state statutes which limit director's liability. Collapse"

112333,1991,journal of urban economics,amenities and regional differences in returns to worker characteristics,amenities and regional differences in returns to worker characteristics,"Average wages in regions in the United States vary considerably. In trying to explain these differences in the average wage across regions a number of studies have found that differences in the returns to characteristics of workers, such as years of schooling, are as important as differences in the skill composition of the labor force [4, 6, 10, 141. These differences in returns are generally interpreted as reflecting regional differences in demand for worker characteristics coupled with barriers to factor mobility. This interpretation is based on the argument that “the presence of at least one perfectly mobile factor, with perfect information will cause spatial convergence in characteristic prices, as that particular factor exploits any spatial price differential” [4, p. 2161. This paper suggests an alternative to this demand-based explanation for regional differences in the structure of wages, one based on regional differences in the supply of worker characteristics.’ This explanation does not rely on impediments to the movement of workers or firms and is consistent with an equilibrium view of wages in which regional wage differentials are viewed as compensation for local amenities. The theoretical model, presented in the following section, assumes capital and labor are perfectly mobile, with perfect information implying that in equilibrium the utility of workers with similar characteristics is the same in all locations. This convergence of utility, however, does not necessarily imply convergence of characteristic prices. Equilibrium differences in the returns to a specific worker characteristic can exist if worker characteristics affect an individual’s valuation of an area’s amenities relative to the individual’s demand for land.

112336,1991,journal of urban economics,"housing appreciation, mortgage interest rates, and homeowner mobility",housing appreciation mortgage interest rates and homeowner mobility,"Abstract This paper presents a model of the optimal timing of tradeup, which considers consumption and investment motives of homeownership. Households determine the optimal timing of trading up so as to maximize their intertemporal utility of both housing and nonhousing consumption. First we consider current homeowners, who already own a house and expect that they trade up to a more valuable house at some point in the future. Housing appreciation tends to induce an earlier optimal timing of trading up. Moreover, housing appreciation makes current homeowners better off in terms of welfare. However, current homeowners suffer from a rise in mortgage interest rates. Second, we consider first-time home buyers, who have decided to buy a house and expect to trade up to a more valuable house in the future. Their initial housing consumption is determined by an initial downpayment constraint. In this case, the effect of housing appreciation on the optimal timing of trading up is ambiguous and, unlike current homeowners, first-time home buyers suffer from housing appreciation. Moreover, as current homeowners, first-time home buyers suffer from a rise in mortgage interest rates. Most of the theoretical analytic results are ambiguous. Accordingly, we perform numerical simulations based on the theoretical model in order to determine the most likely comparative effects for a stylized set of parameters. As is apparent, the model captures the recent observations on homewner mobility and suggests that macroeconomic variables such as housing appreciation and mortgage interest rates effect the optimal timing of trading up and homeowner's welfare. Nevertheless, the model in this paper has several shortcomings, which should be the subject of future research. First, transaction costs are ignored. If transaction costs are incorporated, the lock-in effect from a rise in mortgage interest rates is well explained. However, the general analysis above is not altered in any essential way. Second, multiple moves are not considered in this model. Therefore, we concentrate on the timing of one tradeup as opposed to the timing and frequency of trading up. In a different vein, it would be interesting to test empirically the importance of the effects of macroeconomic variables on trading up by using microdata. Collapse"

The Bolton Report was a problem-oriented analysis of this sector, focusing on the role of small firms in economic development, and providing international comparisons, as a basis for policy recommendations. Since then, and in part because of the report's influence, government policies have been developed to aid small business, and stimulate entrepreneurial activity and innovation. The next step is to research regional entrepreneurial activity, in order to ascertain the effect of potentially divisive regional policies on small business. The problems identified by small business owners remain relatively unchanged, according to surveys conducted by the Small Business Research Trust from 1984-1991. The Bolton Report focused on government burdens, and indeed, conclusions from the surveys show that small business owners are most concerned about costs, and that government taxation is still rated as their biggest burden. A review of small business taxation since the Bolton report finds that policy should promote efficiency rather than maximize employment -- as the Bolton Report had previously suggested -- since small firms do not tend to develop significantly, nor produce high levels of output. The relationship between the small business sector and the banks that finance them is analyzed, and a 'no secrets' relationship is suggested, to facilitate trust and manage risk. The previously overlooked resource of non-owning managers who tend to oversee operations once the small business has exceeded 20 employees is examined. Socioeconomic changes that will affect small businesses in the future include increasing fragmentation of the economy, the rise in the service sector, policy changes and, perhaps most importantly, the adoption of an enterprise culture in the UK.

The workers’ compensation programs’ intent is to provide protection to workers and their families that will compensate for lost wages and medical expenses. Workers are protected under the separate laws of 51 jurisdictions (including the District of Columbia) and two Federal programs-the Federal Employees Compensation Act and the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act.’ In addition, the Federal Black Lung program-a specialized workers’ compensation program-provides monthly cash benefits to totally disabled coal miners, their dependents, and their survivors. Medical benefits are also payable on the basis of a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis (Black Lung disease). Benefits are paid to workers whose disability is the result of a work-related injury or illness and to the dependents of workers whose death resulted from a job-related accident or an occupational disease. Of the $34.3 billion in benefits paid in 1989, approximately 80.9 billion was paid as partial compensation for lost wages and $13.4 billion was paid for medical expenses.

112520,1991,national tax journal,the case for corrective taxation,the case for corrective taxation,"This thesis studies the phenomenon of SME internationalization in the context of the Finnish mechanical engineering and metals industry. The first objective of the study is to identify and examine the Finnish mechanical engineering and metals industry SMEs’ antecedents of internationalization. The second objective is to examine why these SMEs decide to expand their operations into Estonia in particular. The topic of this study is very timely, as the high interest towards Estonia as a target market for Finnish SMEs’ international expansion is expected to continue. The theoretical framework of this study is formed by taking a look at the earlier literature focusing on antecedents of SME internationalization. Existing models, as well as major internationalization theories, are discussed in the light of the research questions and objectives of the study. Since there is a relatively limited amount of data on Finnish SMEs’ internationalization to Estonia available, a broader range of literature on SME internationalization to the CEEC is examined. The empirical research was conducted as a multiple case study of three Finnish mechanical engineering and metals industry SMEs. All of the case companies had expanded into Estonia after the country gained its independence in 1991. The data was collected through personal interviews with the case companies’ founders and key executives. Moreover, some additional and corrective questions were placed by e-mail. Secondary sources were used to complement the data. The results of this study indicate that an in-depth understanding of internationalization antecedents in the Finnish mechanical engineering and metals industry SMEs requires an analysis at three different levels: environmental level, firm level and managerial level. At all levels of the analysis, internationalization antecedents can be divided into two interlinked groups. The first group consists of internationalization antecedents of primary importance. Among other things, the entrepreneur’s prior international experience and commitment to internationalization, the company’s networks, as well as several host country and home country related factors fall into this category. The second group consists of internationalization antecedents of secondary importance, and includes factors such as the global mindset of the entrepreneur, the strategic orientation of the company, and costs of the target market. The key findings of this research show that existing customer networks and the increasing demand for the industry products, in particular, appear to be the most important factors for Finnish mechanical engineering and metals industry SMEs to expand into Estonia. Lower labour and production costs, the Estonian taxation system, and financial benefits for investing companies, in turn, seem to help SMEs make the final internationalization decision in favour of Estonia Collapse"

(1997) 12 Journal of Law and Social Policy A. INTRODUCTION Without a doubt, these have been ""interesting"" times for those engaged in the social policy field. The social safety net in this country has been and is being re-examined strand by strand. Strangely, there appears to be little recognition that it is the strands together which form the net. Each strand is allegedly being made more efficient, more affordable and more cost-effective, with little consideration to the final net which the strands will form when they are finally rewoven. Over the last three years, in Ontario alone, the following programs and legislation have been subject to review and reform: unemployment insurance, the Canada Pension Plan, old age security payments to seniors, workers' compensation and social assistance. Further, the system of transfer payments between the federal government and the provincial government and between the provincial government and its municipalities for the purpose of funding social services and social assistance has been greatly altered. It is difficult to imagine any portion of the ""welfare state"" which has not been touched by some aspect of these reforms. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending upon your outlook), the process is not over. For various reasons, and from various perspectives, it may be useful and necessary to review these different programs, which have evolved over several decades in an independent, haphazard way. What seems to make little sense is that they are being reviewed independently and that the probable result will continue to be independent programs. There needs to be greater recognition of the fact that these programs are financially and administratively interdependent and are meant to protect against or ameliorate certain conditions which are shared by many of the people who rely upon the individual programs. The purpose of this paper is to briefly examine the evolution of these separate reform processes, to summarize the present state of these processes and, most importantly, to analyse the similarities in the issues which are dealt with in these processes and their implications for the welfare state in Canada. B. OVERVIEW OF THE RE-FORMING This overview is presented in a chronological manner rather than on a program by program basis. It is not an attempt at any comprehensive overview or critique of any of the reviews of the particular programs, but rather it is an attempt to convey the sheer magnitude and diversity of the reviews as they unfolded. The starting date for this chronology is October of 1994. It is then that the federal government finally introduced its long awaited (and long delayed) discussion Squandering Our Inheritance paper Agenda: Jobs and Growth Improving Social Security in Canada,3 which set out options for restructuring federal social security programs and spending. While this date might appear to be arbitrary, it is arguable that the prelude to and release of the Green Paper placed social policy issues squarely in the forefront of public consciousness. This is not to suggest that events in the field of social policy prior to October 1994 were of little import. In fact some events prior to this date must be flagged in order to place future developments in context. In 1990 the Progressive Conservative federal government decided, unilaterally, to ""cap"" payments under the Canada Assistance Plan4 to Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, which placed increasing burdens on the budgets of the affected provinces, due to the rise in social assistance costs. 5 A significant federal/provincial initiative was the ""social and economic union"" clause in the Charlottetown Accord. 6 The ""cap on CAP"" and the demise of the Charlottetown Accord probably marked the beginning of the end of the era of cooperative federalism in the area of social policy. Prior changes of significance in the area of unemployment insurance included the federal government's withdrawal as a contributor to the UI fund, increases in the entrance requirements for UI eligibility, a reduction in the number of weeks for which benefits were payable, reductions in the benefit rate payable and an ""enhanced"" rate of benefits for claimants with low earnings. 7 3. (Human Resources Development Canada) (Supply and Services Canada) October, 1994 [hereinafter the Green Paper]. There were also a series of nine supplementary papers released which provided more detailed information about the current system and the options outlined in the discussion paper. 4. R.S.C. 1985, c. C-1 [Hereinafter CAP]. CAP provided for 50-50 cost sharing of social assistance costs between the provinces and the federal government. The ""cap"" on the transfers to these provinces was 5% per year. 5. For a discussion of these implications, see R. Ellsworth & I.

For a discussion of the implications of these changes see Review 1991 at 37, R. Ells(1997) 12 Journal of Law and Social Policy In the area of workers' compensation in Ontario, the changes were no less wide ranging. The beginning of the decade brought some of the most significant changes to the ""historic compromise"" 8 which was at the heart of the workers' compensation system. Bill 1629 eliminated the ""pension for life"" for workers who suffered injuries in the workplace and replaced it with a dual award, wage loss system, in which injured workers received a lump sum award as compensation for the injury and were eligible for further benefits if they suffered a wage loss as a result of the injury. In May of 1994 the NDP provincial government introduced Bill 165.10 Bill 165 introduced a ""purpose"" clause into the Workers' Compensation Actl 1 which required the Workers' Compensation Board to act in a ""financially responsible and accountable manner"". Further, Bill 165 removed the automatic, full inflation protection for injured workers' benefits under the Act and replaced it with a partial indexation formula. The bill also made provision for a special supplement to be paid to the poorest of the permanently disabled workers. 12 It would be tedious and overwhelming to discuss the numerous legislative changes to the social assistance system in Ontario since the start of the decade. Much of the eligibility and entitlement criteria are contained in the regulations made under the two governing pieces of legislation.

NIOS and SOS have the same vision of reaching out to the disadvantaged sections and contribute towards expansion of secondary education. In this paper, we deal with the following questions: (a) Who accesses the ODL system to pursue their secondary and higher secondary education; and (b) Does the flexibility offered, in terms of the five year duration allowed to complete the course, result in higher probability of completion? We examine these questions using Learners data from NIOS at AllIndia level, for the period 2008-2013. The raw student data of NIOS is not in the public domain and therefore has been analyzed for the first time. We use an ordinal logit model to estimate the probability of completion to understand whether the flexibility to complete in five year leads to higher completion rates by using NIOS data in conjunction with data from other national level large surveys such as National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) and District Information on School Education (DISE). The estimates reveal a decreasing trend in probability of completion, where the highest probability is observed in the first year at about 22 per cent. In addition to total learners, we carry out disaggregated analysis for gender and for social groups, and conclude that the flexibility of five years has only marginal effect on completion rates. Introduction In India, NIOS was established in 1989 with the mission to provide relevant, continuing, holistic education to the most marginalised sections of the society for equity and social justice. 1 The enrolment in secondary and senior secondary levels in NIOS has increased from 3,13,922 in 2008 to 4,29,726 in 2013. This growth in enrolment, about 6.15 per cent per year, is impressive especially since it is not concentrated in one or two states but is dispersed across the country. In 2008, Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh constituted 50 per cent of the enrolment in NIOS, wherein that concentration has reduced to 36 per cent by 2013 primarily due to increase in enrolment in states such as Kerala, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Jharkhand. 2 In recognizing the importance of NIOS in providing quality education, the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD) in its draft of New Education Policy (2016) has mentioned initiatives to revamp the Open and Distance Learning system (ODL) to achieve enhanced access, developing skills, capacity building, training, employability and life-long learning (MHRD, 2016). Therefore, at this juncture, it is important to examine the efficiency of the NIOS to increase its reach to the disadvantaged sections and contribute towards expansion of secondary education. In this paper, we examine the reach and efficiency of the NIOS system and the idea of accessibility through two primary questions i) who accesses the NIOS to pursue their secondary and higher secondary education and ii) Does the flexibility offered, in terms of the five year duration allowed to complete the courses, result in higher probability of course completion? These have been examined by using raw learners’ data from NIOS for the period 2008-2013; this is the first such analysis of this data to our knowledge. The paper is structured as follows: (a) brief introduction to the features of NIOS; (b) defining efficiency in the educational system context, especially NIOS; (c) description of methods used and its limitations; (d) discussion of results; and (e) finally conclude with discussion on whether the system is working efficiently. Institutional Context NIOS: NIOS primarily offers three kinds of courses: Secondary, Senior Secondary and Vocational. At secondary, a learner can opt from a pool of seventeen languages and ten additional subjects 3 ; and a learner at senior secondarycan chose between four languages and seventeen subjects 4 . The curriculum offered by NIOS is intended for self-learning; a provision for Personal Contact Programmes (PCP) has been included to facilitate the learning process. These are subject wise classes held at the Study Centres, known as Accredited Institutes (AIs) and Accredited Vocational Institutes (AVIs). 1 Accessed from NIOS website www.nios.ac.in as on August 28th 2016. 2 From 2008, Kerala, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Jharkhand have increased its enrolment by 40 per cent per year. 3 For Certification (Secondary and Senior Secondary) , a minimum of five subjects including at-least one language or at-most two languages are compulsory. NIOS offers flexibility to its learners at several levels to reach out to learners who due to several constraints are unable to continue with their formal schooling. First, there is no upper limit to age for an NIOS learner and admissions are open all through the year. Second, it offers sufficient scope for flexibility through a wide range of subjects and also the option to opt for any combination that the learners deem suitable. Learners in NIOS can also take exams all-round the year, using the facility for on-demand exams. NIOS provides for the option of 'transfer of credit' from other boards. This is especially incorporated to facilitate learners who could not complete the secondary or senior secondary board examination through the regular system. All the information and related forms that need to be filled by learners are available online. The fact that NIOS is highly internet dependent demands a fair amount of internet literacy to be present with learners. In sum, NIOS is driven by two features, firstly it is open in nature, that is to mean that the system is flexible enough to allow for open admissions, and freedom of selection of what, when and where to learn and secondly, the system engages in an educational process where the teaching is conducted by someone who is removed from the learner through space and time, therefore is distanced. These features make the system suitable made for learners who are un-reached, the most marginalised sections of the society along with learners who find it difficult to access regular schools. Defining Efficiency of NIOS: Efficiency is a state in which every resource is optimally allocated to serve each individual or entity in the best possible way. This is a very simplistic definition of efficiency which considers maximization of a given phenomenon within the existing constraints of the environment. The simplicity of the definition orients from the naïve assumption of a simple means to end relationship, although holds true in pure economic contexts. An education system cannot be evaluated in terms of an input-output production function, as the final outcomes of education are broad, relative and multiple in nature. Further, Cooze (1991), Thomas (1982), Thomas (1977) conclude that no two inputs or mix of inputs have the same outcome. It is, thus, important to identify, and define, the factors that comprises of the input and output in order to be able to define efficiency of an education system. Apart from this, the process through which the inputs are delivered to the learners becomes of utmost importance. Thus, the definition of efficiency of an education system should include aspects of access, equity and quality including learning achievements and cost effectiveness measures. There are two kinds of efficiency, internal and external, which are discussed in the education literature (Chapman et al, 1986). Internal efficiency comprises of the output and outcome of the educational system. On the other hand, external efficiency is the measure of the translation of the competencies acquired through the education into private and social benefits. Therefore, internal efficiency can be seen in terms of enrolment, retention, pass percentages, completion rates and so on. The concept of external efficiency is larger and less tangible, where it includes more qualitative indicators like students transforming into sensitive citizens, having choices and freedoms. This paper concerns itself with the first, which is internal efficiency. The discourse on efficiency in the ODL system conflates efficiency with effectiveness (Tattersall, 2006; Hulsmann, 2004). Qualitatively, a system can be seen as effective when it achieves its objectives/mission/goals. These objectives define the character, ways and means of operation for the educational institutions. While it is commonsense that the objective of all educational institutions is to provide quality education but the quality needs to be interpreted and understood with reference to the context. In a system that intends to cater to social, economically and educationally disadvantaged groups, quality cannot be attained without a focus on equity. The primary objective of any ODL system is reaching the unreached (Siaciwena et al 2008; Perraton 2000; UNESCO, 2002; Rupande, 2015). This population could be unreached due to several constraints such as non-availability of adequate number of school/college, infrastructural facilities, transport, communication, cultural factors that restrict mobility of a particular group (especially of girls in India), affordability, physiological disabilities and others. The essence of the ODL system rests on the premise of access; and the system strives to be accessible to those who cannot access regular systems of learning. Thus, we define efficiency of NIOS through its ""ability to reach the unreached in manner that it enables learners from disadvantaged communities, locations and backgrounds to access and complete the chosen level of schooling"".

This paper addresses the question of why, in general, female-headed families are so much poorer than other families. Recognizing that individuals choose their own marital status, a self-selection model is used to identify the factors which determine the poverty rates for married-couple families, families headed by females with no husband present, and families headed by males with no wife present. The following control variables are found to be important determinants of poverty for all three family types: education of family members; age, race, disability, and unemployment of the family head; geographical location, size and composition of the family. Both married-couple families and male-headed families are found to be less poor than female-headed families mainly because the marginal effects of the control variables, and to a lesser extent the mean levels of the control variables, favor the former two types of families over female-headed families.

Becker and Murphy's (1988) analysis of the complimentarity of consumption of a given good over time suggests that people will not always adjust marginally to changes in the parameters of consumption, one of which is surely the presence, absence, or prospects of excise taxation. Lee and Kreutzer's (1982) analysis of the lagged demand curve indicates that any threat to the stability of future property rights — through the imposition of excise taxes or anything else — can have what would be considered, viewed from the accepted paradigm, perverse consumption behavior. Excise taxes in many essential regards represent threats to current and future property rights. As a consequence, for goods whose consumption is interdependent over time, or addictive, excise taxes can retard consumption in both current and future time periods by more than might be thought from the perspective of the standard analytical models. Such a conclusion undermines conventional wisdom, which holds that excise taxes are often designed and applied to products with inelastic demands simply to minimize economic distortions. Collapse"

The results obtained enable us to corroborate this notion, since the model has a high predictive value, and the behavior of the economy, both in terms of level of activity as well as in its changes, comes up consistently as a determinant factor of voting behavior. These results are also consistent with those obtained through Chilean polls in which it has been ascertained that economic events, particularly in the case of those who favored the anti-Pinochet option NO, were of utmost importance in the voters' decisions. The results also confirm the idea that, in Chile, women tend to give economic issues a lesser weight in their political preferences.An implied additional insight is that voters are relatively sophisticated when it comes to interpreting the available information. The most significant economic variables are that of average unemployment throughout the last three years prior to the election, while the variable associated to changes in unemployment over the last year is of lesser consequence. It follows that voters have a “good memory” and willingly write off economic trends which could be deemed as pre-electionary in nature. This entails that, even though economic variables are a key factor in voter's preferences and electoral results, there is no possibility for governments to manipulate these variables and benefit from opportunistic behaviors.

112682,1991,public choice,"rent-seeking, rent-defending, and rent dissipation",rent seeking  rent defending  and rent dissipation,"Summary and conclusionsIn the preceding analyses of rent-defending, the Posner model yielded welfare losses in excess of the combined areas of the Tullock rectangle and the Harberger triangle in only one instance. Furthermore, this particular circumstance necessitated voluntary participation in a game with a negative expected value.13 For the Tullock-Rogerson model, the explicit addition of rent-defenders had no impact on aggregate dissipation.In addition, this paper introduced two implications of nested games on rent-seeking theory. First, in cases where the Posner expected value bid applies, coalitions will not form. Second, coalitions arise as a result of wealth-maximizing behavior in the Tullock-Rogerson strategic game, but contrary to previous authors this model suggests, rent-seeking expenditures fall. However, the organizational and enforcement costs of coalitions reduces the welfare gain and under some circumstances may negate the gains to coalition formation.There seem to be two common pitfalls in the analysis of welfare costs of rent-seeking activities. First, the rent at stake is often incorrectly identified. Second, the method used to allocate rents, or the structure of the game, is not explicitly formulated. Viewing rent as claims to property rights should help alleviate the problems arising from the former, and continuing research into alternative rent-seeking models represents a movement toward the latter.14 Collapse"
112683,1991,public choice,the choice of municipal government structure and public expenditures,the choice of municipal government structure and public expenditures,"Summary and conclusionsNumerous empirical studies have attempted to measure the effect of varying government structures on public expenditures. I argue that these prior may have produced biased estimates, as they are predicated on the assumption that government structures are exogenous.To test the effect of endogenous government structures on public spending, I created an economic model of municipal government choice based on the constitutional choice model of Buchanan and Tullock. The model performed well in predicting the existing government forms of towns in Connecticut.The government choice model was then coupled with a standard median voter model of public expenditure to gauge the effect of chosen government forms on both school and non-educational municipal expenditures. When the choice of government structure is treated as endogenous, school expenditure levels are invariant to government structure. In contrast, per pupil school expenditures are estimated to be significantly lower in representative democracies when government structure is exogenous. In the case of non-educational expenditures, both the endogenous and exogenous government structure models indicate that municipal expenditures are not affected in a consistent way by government structure.The results are consistent with the opinion of Downs (1957) who argues that electoral competition is sufficient to constrain the behavior of elected officials. Indeed, the results suggest that voter preferences not only determine the level of municipal expenditures, but the structure of local governments as well. Collapse"

Our evidence is also consistent with the argument that in the high competition states, the executive power may be viewed as a necessary productive input, while in low competition states such powers could be viewed as alternative ways of allocating political dividends which could be traded with monitory compensation.

112685,1991,public choice,an economic theory of persuasion,an economic theory of persuasion,"features as temporal distance expands, whereas in the present or near future people are likelier to perceive concrete, incidental details (Trope & Liberman, 2003). An additional issue to consider is how accurately public perception of the economy reflects real economic conditions, and how strongly the public values the economy during different economic periods. Economic recessions have been found to increase public attention on economic matters (Headrick & Lanoue, 1991), as well as the importance of economic values (Singer, 2010). Economic recoveries unfold another complication for economic perception. During recessions, there seems to be a general agreement within society on the perception of bad economic conditions, whereas economic evaluations are divided by partisan and ideological lines during recoveries. People who do not support or adhere to the ideologies of the acting governing parties tend to perceive economic conditions as being worse than those who do support or adhere to the acting parties’ ideologies (Stanig, 2013). A final notable point is the complication in interpreting ‘good’ or ‘bad’ economic conditions while studying the effects of economic conditions on public opinion. While overall conditions may essentially seem like good measurement indicators, research has shown that people are somewhat more sensitive to changes in economic indicators – such as inflation, unemployment rate, and GDP – than the absolute ratings/values themselves (Headrick & Lanoue, 1991; Hester & Gibson, 2003; MacKuen et al., 1992). As an example, people may consider a 2% decrease in inflation from the previous month a sign that the economy is in good shape, irrelevant of whether the inflation is actually 10% or 20%. Research relying solely on absolute economic indicator ratings, or solely on changes in these ratings, may lead to inaccurate results. There are benefits to using public economic perception as a basis for investigating the relationship between economic conditions and public attitudes on environmental issues. These benefits arise from several factors: the combined effects of primarily negative media coverage 17 on environmental conditions and the reliance on media for estimating future economic conditions; the varying levels of attention and importance placed on economic values between recessions and recoveries; and the different evaluations of economic conditions stemming from differing political ideologies. Overall, this investigation intends to provide a different insight into the relationship between economic factors and public attitudes towards environmentally related issues, as opposed to simply employing real economic conditions as a basis for examination. 2.4 Framing, Priming and the Media Individuals hold certain cognitive structures that represent personal knowledge and stored ideas/beliefs related to specific objects (Entman, 1992; Shen, 2004). These cognitive structures, or ‘schemas,’ are the basis from which information processing at the individual level takes place (Entman, 1993). Information, events, or messages interact with certain schemas through which the information is interpreted. This interpretation also affects attitudes and opinions towards the information objects (Shen, 2004). As these schemas are constructed at the individual level, the same information may yield different effects on attitudes between individuals as it is processed through the differently constructed individual schemas. Framing, as the term is most commonly understood in political science, is a process in which people develop a particular conceptualization of an issue (Chong & Druckman, 2007) in the form of a particular problem definition, causal interpretation or moral evaluation (Entman, 1993). While psychologists utilize the term ‘individual schemas,’ this concept may be more commonly understood as ‘frame in thought’ within political and media research (Chong & Druckman, 2007; Scheufele, 1999). It is important to distinguish this term from ‘frames in communication,’ in which messages or information is exposed to an individual by a communicator, such as the media (Chong & Druckman, 2007; Gamson & Modigliani, 1989, 1994). By selecting certain pieces of perceived reality, the ‘frame in communication’ thus works with and influences the ‘frame in thought’ (Entman, 1993). This conceptual understanding of framing differs somewhat from another common approach to framing that originates in psychology (Scheufele & Tewksbury, 2007), where framing effects, such as subtle wording alterations, account for observed differences in public choices (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). There are a few ways in which issue framing in communication may affect public attitudes. The first, and perhaps most recognized, is persuading the audience of a certain reality, or of a belief on the causality between an attitude object/issue and an attitude element 18 (Nelson & Oxley, 1999; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). This would be the case, for example, if a message effectively persuaded the audience that an oil-drilling project would have positive economic consequences, which again can influence attitudes changes towards the project. Another way in which issue framing may affect attitudes is by altering or influencing the importance that an audience attaches to particular attitude elements (Gamson & Modigliani, 1989; Nelson, Clawson, & Oxley, 1997; Nelson & Oxley, 1999). An example of such framing effects would be if a message effectively influenced people to place greater importance on environmental factors than economic factors when evaluating the desirability of an oil-drilling project. There are reasons to believe that framing effects of this nature may be stronger than that of the persuasion framing effects (Nelson & Oxley, 1999). A message has a stronger probability to induce framing effects when it interacts with pre-existing schemas and beliefs of an individual (Entman, 1993; Shen, 2004), even if the message content is highly biased or even inaccurate (Teel, Bright, Manfredo, & Brooks, 2006). Therefore, it may be more effective to get individuals to think within specific, existing cognitive elements when evaluating an issue, rather than trying to alter their already reasonably constructed beliefs. Consider, for example, trying to persuade someone to agree to an oil-drilling project when they already believe that the economic consequences would be positive and environmental consequences negative. The chances of getting an agreement for the project is greater if the messenger tries to focus the receiver’s attention on the economic factors of the project, rather than trying to change the receiver’s perception of environmental consequences. While Nelson, Oxley, and Clawson (1997; 1999) believe that the framing occurs mostly through an increase in importance of specific attitude elements following message exposure, the priming theory asserts that framing effects can transpire merely through increased element accessibility in thought (Iyengar & Kinder, 1987; Krosnick & Kinder, 1990; Scheufele, 2000). Faced with a judgment or choice, instead of carefully examining and weighing all plausible considerations, people usually employ simple intuitive shortcuts (or heuristics, see Chaiken, 1987), one of which is to rely upon information that is most accessible in memory or spontaneously comes to mind at a given time (Krosnick & Kinder, 1990). While message exposure can act as a mediator for increased attitude importance, it can also simply affect attitudes in itself with increased accessibility. The main gateway for message exposure and political communication to audiences is through mass media, which therefore has the capacity to considerably shape public attitudes on various issues, whether a deliberate strategy or not. Termed as ‘agenda setting,’ the media 19 emphasis on certain issues can shape the importance attached to these issues by the media audiences (McCombs & Shaw, 1972; Scheufele & Tewksbury, 2007), and can be viewed as the media approach of issue importance framing. Priming has been defined, especially in relation to the media, as a process in which media influences its audience to use specific, tailored issues in their political evaluations (in reference to candidates, elected officials or parties) (Iyengar & Kinder, 1987; Scheufele & Tewksbury, 2007). Priming in this context is not equivalent to, but rooted in, the accessibility increase premises of priming theory, as frequent media exposure can lead to increased accessibility in thought. Existing practice in framing research has been rather focused on ‘deliberate framing,’ but less focus has been given to the incidental ways in which framing can affect attitudes. In this research, deliberate framing means that an established relationship is hinted between an element and an attitude object. Irrelevant of the exact nature of that framing, whether it is by persuasion, affecting importance, or priming certain elements or issues over others, a link is established between an element and an attitude object, suggesting a pathway to which the individual’s cognitive processing should align. For example, measuring differences in public support for an oil-drilling project when framing the consequences as either good for the economy or bad for the environment, rational as it may sound, does still imply a specific effect – positive for the economy, negative for the environment. Two potential complications emerge in this example. First, the mere exposure to a frame claiming either positive or negative effects from a project may alter public opinion on that project just by presenting it in a positive or a negative way. Second, there is an unaccounted possibility that framing, by simply priming the economy or the environment, can incidentally arouse emotions and influence thoughts related to those fields, thus making them more accessible in memory before even making the connection to oil-drilling. This could affect Collapse"

We show that the structure of spatial equilibria remains the same as in the original model. This result continues to hold true under Cournot or Bertrand oligopolistic competition with free entry in the traditional sector. The key factor that explains why the nature of competition in the traditional sector does not matter for the spatial equilibria is constant expenditure shares–due to nested Cobb–Douglas and CES preferences–which imply that trade in the traditional sector is independent from its sectoral characteristics.

112732,1991,quarterly journal of economics,disability transfers and the work decision of older men,disability transfers and the work decision of older men,"The potential causal relationship between the availability and generosity of disability transfers and the nonparticipation rates of older men is often asserted and much studied [Parsons, 1980; Haveman and Wolfe, 1984; Leonard, 1986]. However, estimates of the magnitude of this linkage vary widely: the growth in transfer availability and generosity has been credited with from 30 to 100 percent of the significant post-1960 fall in older male participation rates. The disparity in these research results stems primarily from (1) alternative sources of data that differentially constrain estimation of relevant expected wage and transfer incomes, (2) specifications that are unable to distinguish income transfer from labor market effects, and (3) reliance on measures of health status that are endogenous to the work-leisure decision. This study seeks to narrow the range of estimates by addressing each of these issues. Our utility maximization model of work status choice assumes that workers who differ in health status choose between the mutually exclusive options of working at the wage offered for their characteristics and accepting public or private disability transfers. Because the income flows in the two options are censored, they are estimated using switching regression techniques as expectations conditional on exogenous individual characteristics, hence accounting for the potentially endogenous process that separates wage earners from transfer recipients. The marginal utilities of income from the two sources are allowed to differ because of stigma effects. In the estimation we adjust the choice-based nature of our sample, employ longitudinal earnings data to measure expected changes in (as distinct from the expected level of) income in the two options, and use a separately estimated latent health status measure largely purged of its endogeneity with the participation decision.

In essence, protection provides time and resources for firms to undertake cost-reducing investments. Recently there has been an emergence of new arguments to justify the implementation of ""a national industrial policy"" to encourage investment and to ensure the competitiveness of targeted industries. Also, at the theoretical level a new argument known as ""strategic trade policy"" has emerged. According to this argument, protectionism gives domestic firms strategic advantage against foreign firms to capture a greater share of export markets where rents are not competed away.' Actually, the performance of protectionist programs has been grim. Industries have not adapted, and protection has had to be renewed again and again. Arguments justifying protection have avoided this issue by implicitly assuming that authorities can credibly precommit to eliminate protection. This is a very strong assumption. In fact, government actions are not exogenous, but they are rather the result of an optimization process, or they are best responses to political pressures, as stressed in the public choice literature.2 Therefore, if authorities capitulate to protectionist pressures in the present, they are unlikely to resist them in the future, in the event that the targeted firm would not have adapted. The inability of authorities to precommit to the unconditional elimination of protection generates a trade-off for the firm.

An implication of the i.i.d. assumption is that firms' expectations on future demand are unrelated to the current level of demand. We put forth a model that allows for both the level of current demand and firms' expectations on future demand to change over time; thus it captures two important properties of the business cycle. Our analysis reveals that while the gain to deviating from a collusive agreement is greatest during booms, firms find it most difficult to collude during recessions, as the forgone profits from inducing a price war are relatively low. An implication of this effect for pricing behavior is that at the same level of demand, price is lower when demand is declining than when demand is rising. Consistent with previous theoretical work, we find that firms price countercyclically for a range of values for the discount factor. However, numerical simulations reveal a greater tendency for firms to price countercyclically during recessions than during booms. Collapse"

(1991) The changing geography of the military industry in Britain, Reg. Studies 25, 279–293. A number of studies have suggested that defence spending has had a significant impact on the location of industry and the geography of labour markets. This paper, drawing on a recent study of the employment of research and development professionals in the UK defence industry, confirms that defence spending and related employment has been concentrated in the South and West of England. It also shows that a number of changes are underway. The unusually large British defence industry is restructuring as a result of changes in supply and in demand following the end of the Cold War. Major job losses are in process, which may amount to a third of a million jobs in the 1990s. This is associated with a spatial reorganization, the effect of which is generally to consolidate high-level activities in the industry in the south of England, and deepen the spatial division of labour.

The purposes of this paper are to develop a theory of industrial clustering of information intensive industries, identify intermetropolitan clusters of sectors in the US, to test the relationship between the clustering pattern and metropolitan employment and income growth, and to interpret temporal changes in the clusters. The empirical results reported here are based on factor analyses of employment shares in seventy-seven sectors in the 150 largest metropolitan areas in 1977 and 1986. The sectors are mainly two-digit industries. Also included are nine auxiliary and administrative sectors and three government sectors.

There is another spatial dimension that we explore in this paper, namely, the effect of characteristics of work locations on the occupations held by black and white workers. We address three aspects of this issue. First, are higher quality jobs disproportionately located in areas where whites, rather than blacks, work? Second, do blacks encounter less consumer discrimination, but possibly greater employer discrimination, in employment areas where a larger fraction of the population is black? Third, do locational differences in the mix of jobs between the public and private sectors differentially influence the race-gender specific probability that an individual has a job in a higher wage occupation? Results obtained using the 1980 Public Use Micro-Sample offer no support for the first question. However, the results do suggest that the racial composition of an employment area affects the kind of job a black worker holds, and that blacks and females have a higher probability of having a higher quality job if they work in areas where a larger percentage of the jobs is in the public sector.

Using Granger's (1986) concept of co-integration, we find a long-run equilibrium relationship between the city CD-rate offers and the six-month Treasury bill rate. After filtering out this relationship, a vector autoregressive model is employed with Granger (1969) causality tests to determine the significance of intercity rate dependencies. Our results indicate an increasing number of intercity relations over time, consistent with an emerging integrated market. Since our sample represents a subset of bank CDs for the largest firms operating in six of the nation's largest cities, the results should not be generalized to other smaller bank markets, CD maturities, or bank products. The periods examined are also close together in time, which could affect the robustness of the results. Collapse"

However, two major drawbacks of national accounting have raised doubts about the usefulness of national accounts data for the measurement of long‐term sustainable economic growth and socio‐economic development. These drawbacks are the neglect of (a) scarcities of natural resources which threaten the sustained productivity of the economy and (b) the degradation of environmental quality from pollution and its effects on human health and welfare. In the present paper, the authors attempt to reflect environmental concerns in an accounting framework which maintains as far as possible SNA concepts and principles. To this end, the accounting framework is used to develop a “SNA Satellite System for Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting” (SEEA). Environmental costs of economic activities, natural asset accounts and expenditures for environmental protection and enhancement, are presented in flow accounts and balance sheets in a consistent manner, i.e. maintaining the accounting identities of SNA. Such accounting permits the definition and compilation of modified indicators of income and expenditure, product, capital and value added, allowing for the depletion of natural resources, the degradation of environmental quality and social response to these effects. A desk study of a selected country is used to clarify the proposed approaches, to demonstrate their application in future country studies and to illustrate the quantitative effects of the use of modified concepts on the results of analysis.

In computing Soviet GNP accounts, though, the CIA excludes economic rent in measuring value added. The effect is to value output at average, as opposed to marginal, cost. The exclusion of rent understates the shares of fuels, metals, and agriculture in Soviet GNP, which adversely affects the CIA's calculations of Soviet growth. In this paper, the author estimates the economic rent generated by Soviet extraction of fuels and metals and agricultural production. He then uses the estimates to recompute the shares of these sectors in Soviet GNP, and GNP growth. The results suggest that inclusion of economic rent in value added (or alternatively, marginal cost valuation of output) more than doubles the share in GNP of mining (fuels and metals extraction), and increases agriculture's share during the 1980s from 20 percent to about 25 percent. The reestimates of Soviet GNP growth also differ from those of the CIA by 10–30 percent. Collapse"

Oswald (1984). Likewise, subsidies which assist domestic firms in their competition with foreign rivals are viewed with increasing favor. In order to raise the number of well-paid jobs, high wage or high value added industries should be subsidized or protected from foreign competition; see Bhagwati and Srinivasan (1983). These considerations are of a partial equilibrium nature, however; there is no theory as to how wages are determined and only one industry is examined in an otherwise competitive economy. This paper focuses on the case where the government uses some taxes as policy instruments but balances its budget by other ""revenueraising"" taxes, and where a wage-setting union takes this government behavior as given.' The tax incidence on workers then has an impact on wages, and expansion in one industry raises wages in general and reduces employment in the others, so that the subsidy in one industry implicitly becomes the tax in another. The study proceeds as follows. In Section II we specify the determination of employment and wages in an open economy with one economy-wide union. In Section III, we assume that the government can discriminate between the industries and in Section IV, that the authorities are subject to uniform tax and subsidy rates. In both of these cases, specific policy rules are obtained. Collapse"

Governments may have incentives to change their plans when it is time to carry them out; or in technical terms, the plans may be time inconsistent. A dramatic example is the reaction to a hostage crisis. Governments should announce they will never negotiate with kidnappers to prevent future abductions. After the fact, however, there are strong incentives to break this promise to save the lives of hostages. Of course, intelligent people understand this. So, without commitment, no one expects time inconsistent policies to be undertaken. And, in general, this represents a welfare loss: hostage crises occur. As shown by Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Calvo (1978), credibility is a problem in tax policy. In general, governments have an incentive to change tax rates unexpectedly, for example, to exploit differences between ex-ante and ex-post elasticities. Take the taxation of capital. Ex ante, optimal taxes are low to promote elastically supplied investment. Ex post, the supply of capital is inelastic, so optimal taxes are high. Of course, if governments can change tax rates at any time, then in order to be credible, tax plans should be consistent with future incentives. As with a hostage crisis, this constraint, in general, represents a welfare loss. In a more subtle way, the taxation of labor and consumption is also in general time inconsistent. Optimal tax rates depend on endowments (initial plus acquired). For example, as a rule, tax rates should be high on complements to leisure and other endowments that can be directly consumed.

112993,1991,scandinavian journal of economics,unemployment and income distribution:  time-series evidence from sweden,unemployment and income distribution   time series evidence from sweden,"For a long time, Swedish politicians have been devoted to keeping unemployment at low levels. The main reason for this devotion is probably the belief that higher unemployment increases inequality of income and welfare. This is a reasonable belief since unemployment risks are highest among people with low earnings capacity, even when they have a job. By means of micro data it is easy to verify a marked low-income profile of unemployment. Further, the Swedish unemployment insurance system replaces only about 70 per cent of foregone income and quite many unemployed do not qualify for any benefits; see Bjorklund and Holmlund (1991). Increases in unemployment, however, are associated with many changes in the economy with complex consequences for the personal distribution of income. In addition to the income losses suffered by those who become unemployed, higher unemployment also affects the factor shares of income. The profit share typically declines during recessions and because upper-income groups receive a relatively high proportion of their income from capital income, a countervailing mechanism is involved. Changes in unemployment also affect inflation which, in turn, might influence the personal distribution of income. The distributional effects of inflation are an open question. This note makes an investigation into the relationship between unemployment and the personal distribution of income using Swedish time-series data.

Hence, our results provide a parallel — in the economic context — to the research agenda of Saijo [13] and McKelvey [9] who have established new upper bounds on the size of the strategy space required for feasible implementation of Nash-implementable performance standards in general social choice contexts.

On aggregate, this view of residential segregation in this high Andean city is accurate. However, the results from empirical research among the residents of different types of low-income housing zones point to some considerable variations in the housing careers of the city-born poor and the migrant poor in La Paz. Centrifugal mobility is the general pattern for the low-income groups in La Paz-but the city-born residents usually move over shorter distances than migrants and substantial numbers still locate in the central tenement district. The spatial aspects of housing careers are highly influenced by the geographical distribution of a respondent's contacts in the city. Many migrants nowadays end up in the far periphery of the city's high plateau, whereas the indigenous poor still manage to secure accommodation in the more sheltered parts of the central basin. The other side of the picture is that the city-born poor remain in non-owned accommodation for rather prolonged periods, whereas the migrant poor attain self-help ownership much more quickly.

Policies aimed at creating a “balanced” pattern of urban development in Asian countries over the past three decades have largely failed. Programs to slow rural-urban migration and to control the expansion of metropolitan areas fell far short of their goals. Most governments now recognize that diffusion of urban growth, rather than its control and suppression, is essential for economic development. During the 1990s, Asian governments are refocusing their urban development policies on (1) mobilizing financial resources for investments in services and infrastructure, (2) improving the efficiency of metropolitan areas as economic units, (3) investing in secondary cities and towns with growth potential and integrating urban and rural markets, (4) seeking greater participation of the private sector in urban development, and (5) decentralizing more administrative and financial responsibilities to local governments in urban areas.

Nevertheless, the detailed information painstakingly collected from a small sample of peasant households in an area of Southern Sudan reported here shows that such income inequality is quite significant. The great majority of the population are, no doubt, absolutely poor in the sense that many basic needs goods and services are scarce and income and food security are precarious. Yet, in a situation where arable land is relatively abundant, some households are much better off than others. Indeed, our data suggest that inequality is extreme between rural households in terms of a wide variety of welfare indicators, including the level of current household income. Set in the context of the Chayanov model of peasant household decision making, the paper explores the nature, extent and principal determinants of income inequality in the sampled area. This study establishes that those households which are able to relax the family labor constraint on the size of agricultural harvests and to diversify their principal sources of income away from purely subsistence levels of crop output into production of a marketable surplus, into off-farm income-generating activities and into formal sector wage employment, are able to attain a relatively higher standard of living, according to a range of locally based welfare indicators.

Recent empirical studies of worker behavior in the unorganized sectors of LDCs contradict this view and report evidence of both a forward-falling and an upward-rising labor supply. This study formulates an increasing elasticity of substitution utility function model to analyze the observed behaviors. The function displays both nonhomotheticity and variable elasticity properties, and is capable of generating labor supply curves with forward-falling and upward-rising segments. While the upward-rising supply is considered to be usual worker behavior, the forward-falling segment represents a below-subsistence distress sale phenomenon, and the subsistence income of the worker is implied to occur at the turning point joining the two segments of the supply curve. Econometric estimates of the utility and the labor supply functions provide support to the theoretical results. Collapse"

Attempts to pluralize the curriculum such as Stanford University's Western Civilizations program, New York State's Curriculum of Inclusion, and Portland, Oregon's Multicultural Curriculum effort have been met with bitter opposition by conservative scholars throughout the nation, who have taken this position without benefit of a constructive dialogue with a broad base of minority group repre sentatives. What accounts for this standardized formula response? It is becoming increasingly clear that some private groups have decided, unilaterally, on a course of action for the general public. They are beginning to express xeno phobia at the national level. For example, a recent news article in The Atlanta Constitution ( Auster 1991), cited the fact that the United States is undergoing major shifts in its ethnic population and that Europeans are rapidly becoming the minority. ""Minorities"" are becoming the ""majority."" The great cultural diversity among minority cultural populations, the author feared, will lead to a ""disuniting"" of the United States. This fear is reminiscent of a similar type of thinking present in the 1920s.

Like me, she is a critic of the way the law currently deals with these conflicts, fearing, as I do, that the legal culture tends to trivialize and denigrate religious devotion. So one might have thought we would have a lot in common. So did I, and I anticipated a fruitful discussion of our shared scholarly interest-until the conversation took a disturbing turn. My new acquaintance told me that she was familiar with two of my articles touching on religion and society. But only one of them, she told me, was clearly written by someone who is black. Had she known that I was black, she said, she would have gotten so much more out of the other one.' Puzzled, I asked why this should be so. She seemed surprised at the question. It would, she said, have placed the argument in its proper perspective. This answer, however, only increased my bewilderment. Why, I asked, could she not simply take the argument as it was, evaluating it without regard to the color of my skin? Because, she explained patiently, she needed a context in which to evaluate the argument. Only then, she added gently, might we have a real conversation.2 I found this saddening, and I told her so. In the guise of bringing us together, I suggested, her philosophy (and not only hers!) was actually pushing us apart. The reason, I said, is that she was saying, in effect, ""Tell me about yourself, and then we can have a real conversation.""

113268,1991,yale law journal,form and substance in critical legal studies,form and substance in critical legal studies,"Delinquency, depression, religiosity, and social support have been demonstrated to relate to substance use in adolescence. We examined relations between these factors and substance use (cigarette use, marijuana use, frequency of intoxication using alcohol, and lifetime substance use) using the National Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (ADD Health), a large-scale nationally representative epidemiological study (N = 6504). Our results suggested that: 1) in simple correlations, delinquency and depression appeared to be related to higher levels of all forms of substance use, whereas religiosity and social support appeared to be inversely related with all forms of substance use, 2) in multiple and logistic regression analysis, delinquency remained a predictor of all forms of substance use, 3) depression predicted cigarette use and marijuana use but did not predict frequency of intoxication or lifetime substance use, 4) religiosity predicted lower levels of all forms of substance use, and 5) social support predicted less frequency of substance use but did not predict lifetime use. Results suggest that delinquency and depression may be risk factors for youth substance use, and that religiosity and social support may be associated with decreased risk for substance use. In addition, our analyses suggest that some of these relations may be confounded by other factors or combinations of factors. PREDICTION OF ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE 3 Delinquency, Depression, Religiosity, and Social Support in the Prediction of Adolescent Substance Use: Findings from ADD Health Adolescence is a critical period for the development of substance use (King, Iacono, McGue 2004; CASA, 2011; Moffitt, 1997). The average age of substance use initiation is 13-14 years (CASA, 2011). Rates of many forms of substance use are high in US adolescent populations with three fourths of high school students having used marijuana, alcohol, or tobacco and one eighth meeting criteria for DSM Substance Use Disorders (SUDs). Adolescent substance use is associated with concurrent and future negative outcomes including SUDs with 90% of adults with addiction having tried substance before age 18 (CASA 2011).The increased freedom and independence that comes with adolescence may be partially associated with increases in substance use during this period (CASA, 2011; Moffitt, 1997). Risk and Protective Factors Relating to Adolescent Substance Use. Research on individual differences in the tendency to use substances and to use them heavily has provided evidence for several individual level and environmental factors relating to substance use in adolescence. Risk factors are variables that are associated with a higher likelihood that an individual will experience a negative outcome. Protective factors are variables that are associated with a lower level of a negative outcome. (Hempfill et al., 2011). The factors affecting substance use are diverse and the literature that has examined these topics is multidisciplinary. For example, a literature review conducted by Hawkins, Catalano, and Miller (1992) outlines seven categories of risk factors for adolescent substance use: legal, societal, economic, social, attitudinal, physiological, and psychological. Another review (Hempfill et al., 2011) suggested that risk and protective factors could be categorized by social context: PREDICTION OF ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE 4 communities, families, schools, peer groups, and individuals. Twin and family studies have, using longitudinal data and structural equation modeling, addressed issues related to determining causal pathways (Krueger, 2016; King, Iacono, McGue 2004). Including both risk factors and protective factors in models explaining differences in adolescent substance use is advantageous because risk factors may be fundamentally and conceptually different from protective factors (in addition to differences regarding directionality of effects; Newcomb, Felix-Ortiz; 1992 Stone et al, 2012). For example, it is unclear whether lack of a protective factor should be conceptualized as a risk factor or vice versathe absence of risk factors does not necessarily imply that an adolescent is without risk of using substances (Newcomb, Felix-Ortiz, 1992). In addition, protective factors may be more likely to have a mediated or confounded relationship with substance use than risk factors, which may have a more direct link. Indeed, many studies investigating protective factors focus on factors mediating the relation between protective factors and lower levels of substance use (Baier & Wright, 2001; Wills et al., 2004; Walker et al., 2007; Wallace et al., 2007; Ford & Hill, 2012). Further support for the idea that risk factors and protective factors are discrete constructs comes from research suggesting that risk factors for substance use relate to higher levels of other risk factors and to lower levels of protective factors (Evans et al., 1996; Aukst-Margetic, 2005; Davalos, Chavez, & Guardolia, 2005; Stalk, Love, & Mueller, 2015; Hudson et al., 2015). Similarly, higher levels of protective factors are often related to higher levels of other protective factors and lower levels of risk factors (Evans et al., 1996 Davalos, Chavez, & Guardolia, 2005; Aukst-Margetic, 2005; Harvey et al., 2015; Hudson et al., 2015). Some studies have even constructed separate indices PREDICTION OF ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE 5 for risk factors and protective factors regarding adolescent substance use (Newcomb & FelixOrtiz, 1992). The present study focuses on two risk factors (delinquency and depression) and two protective factors (religiosity and social support) in relation to adolescent substance use. Research has suggested that depression and delinquency are important risk factors for adolescent substance use (Audrain-McGovern, Rodriguez, & Kassel, 2009; Brunelle et al., 2014; Ping, 2007; King, Iacono, & McGue, 2004; Kendler, 1993) and that religiosity and social support may protect against substance use (Nonnemaker, Mcneely, & Blum, 2003; Kovacs, Piko, & Fitzpatrick, 2011; Walker et al., 2007; Lifrak et al., 1997; Wills & Vaughn, 1989). Depression and delinquency-related constructs such as conduct disorder are suggested to be comorbid (Stalk, Love, & Mueller, 2015) and religiosity has been suggested to covary with social support (Harvey et al., 2015). In addition, both delinquency and depression have been suggested to be inversely related to both religiosity and social support (Davalos, Chavez, & Guardolia, 2005; Hudson et al., 2015; Evans et al., 1996; Aukst-Margetic, 2005). These interrelations suggest the possibility of multiple confounds in regards to these factors’ relations to substance use. Delinquency and Depression as Risk factors for Adolescent Substance Use In order to explain substance use in adolescence, risk factors should be examined. Delinquency, a form of externalizing behavior, is the tendency to reject social rules and laws whereas depression is a cluster of internalising symptoms characterized by dysphoria, fatigue, and anhedonia. Depression and delinquency are interrelated and both are factors that may influence adolescent substance use (Brunelle et al., 2014; Watts & Wright; Ping, 2007; King, Iacono, & McGue, 2004; Kendler, 1993). In addition, the relationships between delinquency, PREDICTION OF ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE 6 depression, and substance use may be complex and interactive, and may confound each other (Scalco et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2007). Delinquency. Delinquency has been demonstrated in clinical and epidemiological studies to relate to several forms of substance use including use of alcohol, cannabis, cigarettes, hallucinogens, and opiates (Audrain McGovern, Rodriguez, & Kassel, 2009; Brunelle et al., 2014; Watts & Wright). In a sample of adolescent males, Watts & Wright (1990) demonstrated that substance use explained almost half of the variation in violent and nonviolent delinquency. In a clinical sample of adolescents with substance addiction, delinquency related to higher levels of substance use (Brunelle et al., 2014). Furthermore, Landsman et al. (2011) demonstrated that in a sample of urban minority middle schoolers, a trajectory of delinquency predicted later substance use, but that substance use did not predict later delinquency. Substance use has been conceptualized as a facet of delinquency (Moffitt, 1997) but a factor analysis performed by White (1991) suggests that delinquency and substance use cluster differently in adolescent populations indicating that they may be discrete or partially discrete constructs. Also consistent with the hypothesis that substance use and delinquency are separate constructs is the observation that developmentally, substance use and delinquency are distributed differently across the lifespan, with delinquency usually ending in emerging adulthood and with substance use beginning in adolescence and typically continuing throughout the lifespan (White, 1991; Moffitt, 1997). Recently, research from Krueger and colleagues (2016) using geneticepidemiological studies suggests that delinquency and substance use are influenced by a largely genetic tendency to externalize, or to act out impulses rather than to suppress them. It has also been suggested that adolescents with delinquency use substance to medicate dysphoria (Watts & PREDICTION OF ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE 7 Wright, 1990). Scalco et al. (2014) found evidence of complex interactive effects of externalizing (e.g., delinquency) and internalizing (e.g., depression and anxiety) in relation to substance use. Depression: Depression has been suggested to be associated with adolescent substance use in clinical, epidemiological, and community samples (Ping, 2007; King, Iacono, & McGue, 2004; Kendler, 1993). In a large-scale (N = 16,464) study of Finnish adolescents aged 14-16, individuals who had used substances five times were five times more likely to experience depressive symptomatology than adol Collapse"

The differences between ""conflicts"" and ""disputes"" will be examined, together with what is required to settle or manage conflict. The focu s of this paper will be on interpersonal conflict. After defining ""peace"" it will be argued that conflict resolution is not an entirely satisfactory form of peacemaking . It will be argued that conflict resolution processes such as mediation do not alway s le d to fair and just outcomes for all parties. In analysing conflict resolution it is appropriate to define firstly ""conflict"" and then ""resolution"". While it is acknowledged that confli ct occurs at many levels, from interpersonal disputes to clashes between countries , th focus of this essay will be at the interpersonal level. The term ""conflict"" has b een used to describe a broad range of human activities including hostility between peo le to international war. The traditional notion of conflict as a ""fight, struggl e or clash of principles"" (Oxford Dictionary, 1976) is unsatisfactory because interpe rsonal disputes are rarely about a clash of principles. Coser (1967, cited in Moore, 1 996) has defined conflict more broadly as a ""struggle between two or more people o ver values, competition for status, power or scarce resources (p.16)."" Werthei m, Love, Peck and Littlefield (1998) view conflict as occurring when there are re al or perceived differences in interests (i.e. wants, needs, fears, concerns) that cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Tillet (1991) believes conflict manifests when the needs and values of two or more parties are incompatible. It can be argued that conflict has its origins in o bjective and subjective causes such as competition for external resources (e.g. power, lan d or status) or it can arise when there is a clash between the internal beliefs, valu es, and interests of two parties. Authors such as Moore (1996) and Tillet (1998) perc eive conflict as occurring at various levels of consciousness. These commentator s distinguish between latent conflict characterised by underlying and sometime s unacknowledged tensions and emerging conflict where the dispute is acknowledg ed and the parties are identified but a process for resolving the dispute has yet to merge and manifest conflicts where the parties engaged in the dispute have reach ed an impasse despite attempts at resolution. At this stage the conflict is overt and i ividuals can pursue resolution through legal action, mediation, negotiation or phy sical or verbal violence. There is debate as to whether it is useful to disti nguish between conflicts and disputes. Tidwell (1998) regards conflicts and disp utes as part of the same continuum with the main differentiating factor being that con flicts tend to be of greater intensity than disputes and are less subject to negotiation . Tillet (1991) highlights the differences between conflicts and disputes by drawi ng attention to the contrasting sources of tension. He argues that disputes occur when there are competing interests or goals whereas conflict has its origins in funda mental differences in human values and needs. An interesting consideration arising fr om this issue is whether solutions in the form of resolution or settlements represent the desired outcome for both conflicts and disputes. If the cause of the problem differs b tween conflicts and disputes as it does in some cases, so may the preferred outcome an d approach to managing or solving the problem. For instance, an estranged c ouple arguing over the distribution of property may simply require a settlement to this problem. However, a couple who seek relationship counselling because of marital di fficulties may benefit from conflict resolution strategies aimed at identifying the unde rlying sources of tension in the relationship. Such a strategy ""deals with the tota l human being"" (1998, Burton, cited in Tillet, 1991, p.1) by addressing the values and motivations that fuel the conflict as opposed to simply addressing a symptom of the probl em. Similarly, the concept of ""conflict resolution"" is also open to many interpretations. On one hand, conflict resolution can be regarded as any process that resolves or ends conflict via methods which can include violence or warfare. Alternatively, it can be viewed as a non-violent process that manages confli t through compromise, or through the assistance of a third party who either facilitates or imposes a settlement or resolution. Conflict resolution processes are many and varied and can be seen on a continuum ranging from collaborative, participatory , informal, non-binding processes (such as mediation, conciliation, third party negot iation) to adversarial, fact-oriented, legally binding and imposed decisions that arise fr om institutions such as the courts and tribunals (Boulle, 1996). Typically, non-adver sarial practices such as mediation, negotiation, arbitration and conciliation are pract ices which have been associated with conflict resolution or alternate dispute resolution (ADR) procedures rather than adversarial institutions such as courts and tribuna ls where a settlement is imposed on the disputants by an external authority (Boulle, 19 96). In contrast mediation, conciliation or negotiation are activities that fac ilitate communication between participants who are seeking to resolve their diffe rences in a cooperative way. Some commentators such as Wertheim et al (1998) and Fisher and Ury (1996) believe that the key to resolving conflict is to focus on i nterests rather than positions, which is the solution one party seeks to impose on another. Bu ton (1986, cited in Tidwell, 1998) has argued that resolution between two partie s in conflict can only occur when ""relationships have been re-examined and realigned"" (p.9). Although this form of resolution may by regarded by some as more desirabl e it is not always practicable. Resolution in cases of marital separation or divorc e can in some cases simply mean the settlement of an outstanding property dispute r ather than the ""realignment of relationships."" The ""transformation"" of relationshi ps may be an ideal pursued by a third party who is intervening on behalf of the dis putants, but it is not necessarily the goal of the disputants who may simply desire a solu tion to their problem. Laue (cited in Charles Sturt University, 1998) has argued that conflict can only be considered resolved if the following conditions are met: • The solution jointly satisfies the interests and needs of the parties via joint agreement. • The solution does not compromise the values of ei ther party. • The parties do not repudiate the solution even if they have the power to do so following the settlement. • The solution is fair and just and becomes self-su pporting and self-enforcing. Although this form of resolution seems ideal becaus e it aims to achieve an enduring outcome it is not always practicable in situations where the relationship between two parties is severely strained or when there is no on going relationship to be maintained. In such situation parties in conflict will often at tempt to maximise their gains at the expense of the other through the negotiation or bar gaining process (Boulle, 1996). To summarise, conflict resolution can be viewed as a p roblem solving process which is designed to offer parties an opportunity to resolve their differences collaboratively. This process often involves third parties who emplo y techniques and methods that are aimed at facilitating communication between parties engaged in conflict. Before answering the question of how conflict resol uti n is related to peacemaking it is important firstly to consider what is meant by t he erm ""peacemaking"". The relevance or otherwise of conflict resolution proce sses to peacemaking needs to be considered in the light of the meaning given to thi s erm. Laue (cited in Charles Sturt University, 1998) has defined peacemaking as the ""a ctive process of peace, the behaviour of actors and institutions that leads to more peaceful relations"" (p.303). Peace is considered by Laue (cited in Charles Sturt University, 1998) as the state of relations between individuals or groups that is cha racterised by the absence of war, the presence of social justice and economic wellbei ng, and the respect of human rights. Galtung (1985, cited in Barash, 1991) used th term ""positive peace"" to denote a society that is free of overt as well as s tructural or institutionalised violence which permits its citizens to enjoy economic, socia l advancement, political equality and freedom from oppression. In considering whether conflict resolution as defin d previously is related to peacemaking the question needs to be asked whether conflict resolution processes facilitate peace. It is debatable whether processes uch as mediation or negotiation when applied to interpersonal, community, or organi s tional disputes constitute activities that can be regarded as peacemaking. Al though the process of conflict resolution in these cases may generate a mutually a greed upon settlement that results in improved relations between parties it does not n ecessarily meet Galtung's (1985, cited in Barash, 1991) and Laue's (cited in Charles Sturt University, 1998) definition of a peacemaking activity. These commentators have argued that peace is defined by the presence of justice and equality in society as well as the absence of war or structural violence. Although conflict resolution procedures may be indicative of a society that encourages reconciliation between indi v duals (e.g in a community, organisational or interpersonal context) it is not a an activity that can be regarded as ""peacemaking"" unless it addresses problems that ari se from the absence of peace (e.g. war, injustice or structural violence). In addressing the question of whether conflict reso lution procedures are ""always fair and just to all parties"" this essay will confine it s d Collapse"
113298,1991,accounting review,efficiency of asset valuation rules under price movement and measurement errors,efficiency of asset valuation rules under price movement and measurement errors,"Synopsis and Introduction: Errors arise in measuring changes in prices of assets due to imperfection and incompleteness of asset markets. Furthermore, the rates of price-change, and the magnitudes of errors of measurement vary and are often correlated across assets. Suppose we characterize an economy by means and variances of price changes for individual goods and of measurement errors in these changes as well as by the degree of diversification in the asset portfolios held by individual firms. In such an economy, the linear valuation rule that yields the most efficient estimate of change in the economic value of these asset portfolios is the one that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE). This paper presents a linear aggregation model of valuation to help understand how the minimum MSE valuation rule is affected by various parameters that characterize the economy, and the circumstances under which historical-cost valuation rule yields a (statistically) more precise estimate of the unobserved economic value of firms' assets than the current valuation rule. The analytical findings of the paper are consistent with the reluctance of accountants to depart from historical cost in spite of the existence of low inflation, and in spite of scholarly critiques of this valuation rule by Chambers (1966), Edwards and Bell (1961), Sterling (1970) and others. They are also consistent with the use of specific price indexes by most firms to prepare SFAS 33 disclosures. Several testable implications of the results are provided. Collapse"

During 1987, most major U.S. banks, led by Citicorp on 19 May 1987, announced large increases in their loan loss reserves because of problem loans in lesser developed countries (LDC). With substantial flexibility in accounting rules for determining loss exposure, the banks announced varying levels of reserve increases. On 14 December 1987, the Bank of Boston began a second round of activity relating to LDC debt by announcing a $200 million write-off of LDC loans and further increase in loan loss reserves. Financial reporters suggested that these events could be interpreted differently. Because Citicorp was a leading money-center bank, its announcement could be interpreted favorably as a signal of willingness to deal with the LDC debt problem. This interpretation could similarly apply to other banks, especially the more exposed money-center banks. In comparison, the Bank of Boston announcement was portrayed in the press as detrimental to the money-center banks for two reasons. First, unlike a reserve increase, a write-off reduces a bank's capital adequacy ratio. Capital adequacy ratios are used by bank regulators in determining the need for, and the level of, supervisory intervention. Second, the write-off Collapse"
113322,1991,american economic review,wage indexation and discretionary monetary policy,wage indexation and discretionary monetary policy,"Since the early 1970's, both academic researchers and policymakers have devoted considerable attention to the macroeconomic effects of wage indexation. However, these two groups have focused on different effects. Starting with Jo Anna Gray (1976) and Stanley Fischer (1977a), formal models emphasize the role of indexation in stabilizing or destabilizing output. In contrast, informal policy discussions usually focus on the allegation that indexation is inflationary (e.g., Arthur Okun, 1971; Mario Simonsen, 1983; Eliana Cardoso and Rudiger Dornbusch, 1987). To reduce this gap, this paper presents a model of the effects of indexation on inflation and asks whether indexation raises economic welfare when these effects are taken into account. Until recently it was difficult to formalize the argument that indexation is inflationary, because economists lacked models of the sources of inflation. This paper applies the insight of Robert Barro and David Gordon (1983a) that, with discretionary policy, the employment gains from surprise inflation tempt the monetary authority to create positive trend inflation. As stressed by Fischer and Lawrence Summers (1989), policies that reduce the costs of inflation, such as indexation, cause Barro-Gordon policymakers to choose higher inflation. Indeed, inflation can rise so much that welfare falls despite greater protection against inflation. This effect is appealing because it captures the common argument that indexation weakens policymakers' will to fight inflation.1 This is not the end of the story, however, because wage indexation has a second effect: it reduces the employment effects of surprise inflation. That is, unlike most policies to reduce the costs of inflation, such as indexation of interest rates, wage indexation steepens the Phillips curve. In the BarroGordon model, a steeper Phillips curve reduces the temptation to inflate and hence reduces equilibrium inflation. Since indexation has one inflationary effect (lower costs of inflation) and one anti-inflationary effect (a steeper Phillips curve), the net effect appears ambiguous. Even if the net effect on inflation is determined, the welfare effect may remain unclear: if inflation rises, the welfare loss might or might not be outweighed by the lower cost of a given amount of inflation.2 These ambiguities cannot be resolved with the Barro-Gordon model alone, because the Phillips curve and the effect of inflation on welfare are ad hoc. It is plausible that indexation affects these relations, but the relative strengths of the effects are unclear. Resolving the ambiguities requires a more structural model in which the effects of indexation are derived, rather than assumed. This paper studies such a model; specifically, we use a model of staggered wagesetting based on Gray (1976), Fischer (1977a, b), and John Taylor (1980). The degree of indexation is an explicit parameter, and so we can derive its net effects on inflation and welfare.

113331,1991,american economic review,"group composition, collective consumption, and collaborative production",group composition collective consumption and collaborative production,"We can distinguish two different approaches to agro-food consumption. The main model follows the value chain nutrition rules and it is focused on establishing the quality and product pricestability. At the same time, strengthening the short circuits of commercialization is significant, as an alternative to the main model. These initiatives, which have different working matters, promote the roll to involve consumers in the consequences of their consumption habits. In addition, these types of consumers value direct connection between producers and local stakeholders. In the context of Network Society, ICT adoptions offer a tool to organize these short circuits of commercialization business. This article studies the case of the municipality of Sant Cugat del Valles, located close to Barcelona metropolitan area and where we can recognise much of the short circuit of commercialization patterns. On the one hand, we are evaluating if the proliferation of these initiatives into the proximity territory can offer a consumption alternative thanks to the interaction between producers and consumers. On the other hand, taking into account the Case of Sant Cugat del Valles, we are going to analyse the significance of a new pattern between rural and urban space relations through agro-food consumption. VALUE CHAIN VS. LOCAL FOOD MOVEMENT The value chain model is the dominant one in Spain. This theory started by Porter (1985) describes activities developed in a sector or a business so as to generate value to the final customer. Toribio et al. (2012) analyses the distributed organization of agrofood products as a piece of value chain under Porter’s theory. The possibility to control the quality and regulate prices has been the main reason to implant this economical model. The value chain model has developed some strategies to improve agro-rural food commercialization. Indeed, food commercialization has a big importance for economy. According to Mauleon (2009), 25% of TV advertisements are focused on food. Even though food is a priority for marketing, the ‘consumer deskilling’ is growing (Jaffe and Gartler, 2006). A lot of consumers have missed their knowledge and required abilities to evaluate the products they consume. In this sense, Internet has been proposed as a tool to connect without any intermediaries. But as 1 Pere Losantos is Innovation professor at UOC Business School, Barcelona, Catalonia (plosantos@uoc.edu). Ricard Espelt is ICT for Rural Development researcher in i2TIC at IN3·UOC (ricardespelt@uoc.edu). we have mentioned before, the value chain has created an opaque gap between producer and consumer. Although the consumer is able to buy agrorural food products in a supermarket chain in ‘one click’, he/she does not know a lot of things about them. In the majority of cases, Chris Anderson’s theory (Long Tail, 2004) interpretation has developed an Internet vision as a space where costumers anywhere in the world are able to buy whatever product they want. According to that, the idea of selling to any place around the world is possible and that strategy strengthens another consumer group around the product. In spite of that marketing vision, the investigations give ITC other opportunities better connected with the sense of local food movement. In that vision, the priority is not to keep the possibility to be able to sell anywhere around the world through the Net, but to engage citizens around the product they consume. The result is a community, which has a big connection with local localization and using ICT to organize and collaborate among them. Local food movement works in that sense. This model has reached another approach to food consumption, through short circuits of commercialization, with some successful examples, based on engagement and networks. This model believes the main current system of food consumption is acting against the benefits of people. Their structures are not vertical and lineal like the way big supermarket chains work. They work as a net of knowledge. In addition, their goal is not economical benefit; it is improving the quality of population feeding and increasing local development. Local food movement, which is based on permaculture, tries to give a positive and encouraging answer to communities in front of peak oil, climate destruction and economic instability (Hopkins and Pinkerton, 2009). SHORT CIRCUIT BUSINESS MODELS Nowadays, effervescence of short circuits of commercialization, which, in fact, has never disappeared, is growing in a lot of countries so as to follow the local food pattern. New models of commercialization have been arising during the last years allowing new approaches between production and consumption, as well as, urban and rural world. Binimelis and Descombes (2010) represent the short circuits commercialization focusing on the proximity between producer and consumer, understood in terms of relocation and resocialization strategy. They define a large list of business forms: specialized shops, consumer cooperatives, consumers’ cooperatives, producers’ and consumers’ cooperatives, producers’ cooperatives & collective place Collapse"
113332,1991,american economic review,social networks and labor-market outcomes:  toward an economic analysis,social networks and labor market outcomes   toward an economic analysis,"This paper examines deregulation from an institutional perspective. Although deregulation is commonly framed as the diminution of state control and a return to “the market,” the paper argues that this portrayal fails to acknowledge both the complexities of governance and the role of the state in shaping decisions about governance. It is argued that the category of “the market” subsumes a variety of governance mechanisms that economic actors use to coordinate their behavior. Moreover, the market-state dichotomy within which discussions of deregulation are commonly framed ignores the central role of the state in shaping decisions regarding governance. Following deregulation, industry actors commonly employ various governance mechanisms (e.g., long-term contracting, obligational networks) that have little in common with classical markets. Moreover, the evolution of governance regimes is not simply driven by efficiency concerns but is shaped by public policies and institutions. Thus, even under deregulation, the role of law and institutions is foundational. The paper illustrates these points through three cases of deregulation in the United States: commercial aviation, railroads, and finance. Jerusalem Papers in Regulation & Governance © Marc A. Eisner W o rk in g P a p e r N o . 3 | A p ri l 2 0 1 0 Beyond the Logic of the Market: Toward an Institutional Analysis of Regulatory Reforms After a nearly a century of regulatory expansion, the United States entered a period of regulatory reform in the mid-1970s. During the previous decade, the case for government regulation came under prolonged scrutiny. Activists consumer movement and identified serious cases of regulatory failure and compiled case studies that reinforced earlier scholarly works on regulatory capture and life cycles (see Herring 1938, Huntington 1952, Bernstein 1955, Kolko 1963). The critique of regulation was not the sole property of the left. Chicago school economists were developing the economic theory of regulation, modeling regulation as a series of mutually-beneficialexchanges between profit-maximizing firms and vote-maximizing legislators (see Stigler 1971). Despite the obvious ideological differences, there was a broad consensus that many regulations protected the regulated interests, foisting the costs on to the public. As the arguments against regulation mounted, stagflation created a window of opportunity for policy change. Excessive regulation was linked—albeit, often only rhetorically—to rising inflation, stagnant growth, and flailing competitiveness. Policymakers concluded that the costs of economic regulations often exceeded whatever benefits might be claimed. Deregulatory initiatives were successfully introduced in commercial banking, communications, and air and surface transportation. In some cases, these initiatives mandated the wholesale elimination of well-established regulatory agencies. When combined with the rejection of Keynesian demand management, the promotion of greater trade liberalization, and welfare reform, deregulation became one of the pillars of neoliberalism. If earlier policy regimes had vested authority in state institutions in the hope of forcing higher levels of corporate accountability and compensating for market failure, these grants had been revoked in the name of efficiency. Deregulation was only one part of the reform agenda. Beginning in the early 1970s, presidents established ever more demanding systems of regulatory review. Although the Ford and Carter administrations imposed relatively unobtrusive analytical requirements such that agencies could often compose cost-benefit analyses ex post facto, the Reagan presidency marked a sea change. In 1981, Reagan‟s Jerusalem Papers in Regulation & Governance © Marc A. Eisner W o rk in g P a p e r N o . 3 | A p ri l 2 0 1 0 executive order 12291 required agencies to submit regulatory impact analyses grounded in cost-benefit analysis to the Office of Management and Budget‟s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OMB OIRA). If agencies failed to make the affirmative case that new regulations generated net benefits, OMB OIRA was authorized to prohibit them from publishing notice of rulemaking in the Federal Register, thereby stopping the regulatory process (McGarity 1991). Even if the new social regulatory agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) survived the deregulatory fervor of the era, they were deeply impacted by the new review requirements. The timing of costs and benefits intrinsic to many social regulatory policies—they imposed large initial compliance costs and generated a flow of benefits that accrue in the distant future—were particularly difficult to justify when discounted to present value. Moreover, the costs of completing the regulatory impact analyses stressed the resources of agencies already working under significant budgetary constraints. There is much to suggest that the introduction of regulatory review processes had less to do with the promotion of market values than with inter-branch conflicts (see Percival 1991, 2001). In the 1970s, Congress passed the costliest regulatory statutes in US history. Responding to the above-mentioned critiques of regulatory capture and anxious to assert control over new agencies, legislators wrote exhaustively detailed regulatory statutes that limited the discretionary authority of regulators and, by implication, the capacity of the President to manage the regulatory state. By vesting authority in the OMB within the Executive Office of the President, regulatory review partially redressed the perceived imbalance of power. Although it was convenient in the 1980s to attribute these changes to the Reagan administration‟s anti-regulatory ethos, these processes were retained, albeit with modifications, by subsequent presidents, regardless of party affiliation and agenda. One can surmise that they were embraced, in part, to mange the balance of power between the President and Congress. This essay focuses on deregulation and the role of the market. Advocates of deregulation claimed that the market could produce results superior to the state. And yet, as will be argued below, if we replace the broad and imprecise category of “the market” with a more institutionally-rich understanding of economic governance, we Jerusalem Papers in Regulation & Governance © Marc A. Eisner W o rk in g P a p e r N o . 3 | A p ri l 2 0 1 0 discover that deregulation produced results that often bore little resemblance to classical markets. Rather, what emerged were complex governance structures that, in some ways, served coordinative functions comparable to what had existed under regulation. Moreover, these governance decisions were not simply the product of chance or the search for efficiencies. They were shaped by public policy and investment decisions. The following examination proceeds in three stages. First, it explores the limitations of the market-state dichotomy. Second, it turns to consider regulation and deregulation through the lens of governance, with a brief survey of three cases of deregulation: airlines, surface transportation, and finance. Finally, the discussion concludes with a consideration of the merits of adopting an institutional perspective when considering the dynamics of deregulation. Public Authority and the Market Much of our thinking about public policy is shaped by the market-state dichotomy. The market is portrayed as a pre-political world populated by self-interested rational actors executing mutually beneficial voluntary transactions. In sharp contrast, the state is portrayed a world of coercion in which large bureaucratic organizations impose sanctions to force individuals to do things that they might otherwise choose not to do in hopes of achieving some larger, overarching social goals. The positive theory of market failure offers some technical guidance as to when the state can “intervene” in the market system (See Weimer and Vining 1999, pp. 74-116). That is, interventions are justified if they address various forms of market failure. Of course, even if such justifications exist, critics caution, the costs of government failure may nonetheless surpass the benefits of intervention. As Charles Wolf, Jr. (1990, p. 6) observed: “The choice in actuality is among imperfect markets, imperfect governments, and various combinations of the two. The cardinal economic choice concerns the degree to which markets or governments—each with their respective flaws—should determine the allocation, use, and distribution of resources in the economy.” Jerusalem Papers in Regulation & Governance © Marc A. Eisner W o rk in g P a p e r N o . 3 | A p ri l 2 0 1 0 As powerful as the market-state dichotomy has been in structuring our thinking and public discourse about the political economy (Lindblom 1982), the conceptual bifurcation veils the variety of institutions subsumed by “the market” and the role that the state plays in creating the institutional foundations for the economy. Markets are institutions that facilitate the exchange of property. For property rights to be effective, they must be definable, defensible, and divestible or transferable (Yandle 1999). In each of these dimensions, the state plays a foundational role (e.g., by awarding titles, providing laws that govern transactions, and maintaining institutions for the adjudication of property disputes). Thus, rather than existing as a selfconstituting and self-regulating sphere of human action, markets are constituted by public policies and institutions. We can gain some additional insights into the state-market nexus by exploring the legal foundations of economic activity. The key actors in the economy— corporations, trade associations, labor unions, banks—are legally constituted entities (See Edelman and Suchman 1997). Consider the corporation. One can model the corporation as a production Collapse"

The present study used the stochastic frontier production approach to decompose sources of TFPG of organized manufacturing into technological progress, changes in technical efficiency, scale effect and changes in allocative efficiency during 1981/ 82-2010/11. According to the results, technical inefficiency, though exists, is time invariant and technological progress (TP) became the main contributor to TFPG of the sector during 1981/82-2010/11. Furthermore, TFPG of organized manufacturing in most states in India declined during the post-reform period due to the decline in technological progress. Introduction Most of the studies relating to productivity growth in Indian manufacturing considered technological progress to be the unique source of total factor productivity growth (TFPG) and it can be shown by the shift in production possibility frontier over time. However, some recent studies (Aigner, Lovell & Schmidt, 1977; Meeusen & Van den Broeck, 1977) have used a stochastic frontier production model that allows decomposing TFPG into two components: technological progress (TP) and change in technical efficiency (TE). Later, studies by, among others, Nishimizu and Page (1982), Kumbhakar (1990), Fecher and Perelman (1992), Domazlicky and Weber (1998) have been focusing on decomposition of TFPG using Stochastic Frontier Approach. Some studies have extended their analyses to deal with the issues of scale effect and allocative efficiency effect. By applying a flexible stochastic translog production function, Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000), Kim and Han (2001) and Sharma et al (2007) decomposed TFPG into four components: changes in technological progress, changes in technical efficiency, economic scale effect and changes in allocative efficiency. In the present study we have used the stochastic production frontier approach to decompose TFPG of the total organized manufacturing industries in India and fifteen major industrialized states assuming that manufacturing industries in the states are not able to fully utilize the existing resources and technology because of various non-price and organizational factors that might have led to technical inefficiencies in production. Using panel data of the organized manufacturing industries of the states as well as all-India over a period from 1981-82 to 2010-11, pre-reform period (1981-82 to 1990-91), post-reform-period (1991-92 to 2010-11) and also during the two decades in the post-reform period (1991-92 to 2000-01 and 200102 to 2010-11], we have decomposed TFPG of the organized manufacturing sector into technological progress, changes in technical efficiency, scale effect and allocative efficiency effect. This decomposition of TFPG of Indian manufacturing has also been made for the pre-and post reform periods, and also for different decades in order to examine the trend and variations in the TFPG and its different components, during these sub-periods. Decomposition of TFPG Stochastic frontier model was first developed by Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977) and Meeusem Van den Broeck (1977) and it was later extended by Pit and Lee (1981), Schmidt and Sickles (1984), Kumbhakar (1990) and Battese and Coelli (1992) to allow for panel data regression estimation in which technical efficiency and technological progress vary over time and across different production units. Here we discuss the methodology used in the efficiency literature for estimating stochastic production frontier and the decomposition of TFPG. We start with a standard stochastic frontier model that can be estimated using panel data. The model is written as: [y.sub.it] = f([x.sub.it], [beta], t) exp ([v.sub.it] - [u.sub.it])--(1) where [y.sub.it] represents the output of the i-th production unit (i=1 . … Collapse"

The monetary dynamics of the hyperinflation is well characterized by the Cagan model. With revealed cointegration between real money and inflation, the model is accepted irrespective of the underlying expectations formation process and it implies stationary velocity shocks. Employing cointegrated VAR, the exact rational expectations Cagan model is rejected and an informal test within the same framework shows that the Yugoslav public exhibited a lower degree of forward-looking behavior relative to that in other classical hyperinflations. This enabled the government to extract non-decreasing seigniorage by increasing money growth and inflation above expected rates and suggests an explanation for the ever-increasing money growth in spite of the resulting monetary chaos.

We also expand on Chiswick and Miller’s work by doing regressions for both males and females and by comparing to Chinese immigrants, a representative group from a less developed country. We find that the negative assimilation hypothesis does not hold for the Canadian labor market.

Specifically, Greece transformed itself from an agricultural economy with virtually no industrial base to an economy with a significant industrial sector and consequently a relatively high income per capita. One can explain this on the lines of a Kaldorian framework. In this paper we provide an outline of Kaldor's growth model and test its relevance to the economic experience of Greece during the 1967-1988 period. The empirical results suggest that the model can adequately explain the developments in the economy to a considerable degree Collapse"

However, the sweeping changes and the deregulation in the financial industry have greatly affected the relevance of these traditional monetary aggregates. The unusual behaviour of the simple-sum monetary aggregates has forced the Federal Reserve to stop setting target range for M1. The measuring of monetary aggregates has become a controversial question. This paper constructs the new-benchmark Divisia monetary indexes which reflect ‘moneyness’ more accurately than the old Divisia indexes. I demonstrate that the historical trends of the Divisia monetary indexes are sensitive to the brenchmark rates chosen in constructing these indexes. In addition, I compare the forecasting performance of the new-benchmark Divisia monetary indexes with the simple-sum and the old Divisia monetary indexes in the... Collapse"

Several researchers recommend modified or expanded versions of the market model as a means of improving its predictive capabilities. One such approach is the lower partial moment model. The purpose of the present paper is to assess the robustness of the lower partial moment model relative to the conventional CAPM as a basis for estimating the cost of a utility company's equity capital.

While some household characteristics vary in the extent to which they significantly affect the level of lottery expenditures across regions (wealth, age, occupation, mother tongue and urban location, for example), others are significant in every region. Regional consistency exists in the statistical significance of after tax household income, sex and education of the head of household – lottery expenditures increase as incomes increase; lottery expenditures are significantly lower for female heads of households than for their male counterparts; lottery expenditures decline as the education level of the head of household increases. Second, lottery expenditures are found to be regressive, although the degree of regressivity is less than for lotteries in the United States. Collapse"

To comprehend some of this complexity, we focus on the patterns of spouse choice for both men and women in central Java. The extent of parental control over mate selection is examined for change over time, gender differences, and likely determinants, including family class, education, premarital work, and residence. It is argued that the current marriage transition in Indonesia reflects both gender and generational hierarchies in the Javanese family system. The analysis is conducted using a multinomiallogit model; in general, it yields results strongly supportive of the argument that the determinants of spouse selection differ by gender. The results also show that although there is a dramatic shift towards self-choice marriages, it is occurring within the context of historical and institutional factors specific to Javanese society.

The limiting distribution of the LAD estimator is that of a functional of a bivariate Brownian motion, similar to those encountered in cointegrating regressions. By appropriately correcting for serial correlation and other distributional parameters, the test statistics introduced here are found to have either conditional or unconditional normal limiting distributions.

However, the approximation to the static forecast errors distribution includes skewness and kurtosis terms. Thus the class of multivariate normal distributions does not provide as good approximations (in terms of error convergence rates) to the distributions of the static forecast errors as to the distributions of the dynamic forecast errors. These results cast some doubt on the appropriateness of model validation procedures, such as Chow tests, which use the static forecast errors and implicitly assume that these have a distribution which is well approximated by a multivariate normal.

For example, many people support physical abuses by law enforcement officials, even though they might violate constitutional rights. The First Amendment, simple in original wording, has resulted in a vast amount of court cases and legislative action. However, a wide variety of examples demonstrates that the principle of freedom of expression apparently has very little public support. Government often operates with a powerful motivation toward secrecy, such as in the operation of foreign affairs and in the suppression of news about the Gulf War. News organizations also showed during the Gull' War a tendency to avoid expressions of public outrage, and most did not protest government censorship, which the public overwhelmingly supported. In the schools, freedom of expression gives way to thought control. Various groups work to prohibit controversial texts. Students are forced to conform to dress and speech codes, and are often harassed if they try to exercise civil freedoms. Colleges are ruled by attempts to impose restrictions on speech not deemed politically correct, but the anti-politically correct advocates are also guilty of hypocritical intolerance. Colleges also participate in acts of secrecy. The schools and government both exhibit hostility toward freedom of expression, but this is a general tendency throughout society. It may be that, in today's America, dearly holding to the precepts of the First Amendment has become a thing of the past.

The difficulty with a low-cost cost-leadership strategy in the airline industry is that market position is unprotected by barriers associated with economies of scale. In other industries, scale economies create barriers by presenting potential entrants with a choice of either entering after making a huge investment in scale facilities or accepting a decidedly inferior market position. In the airlines, scale economies are virtually nonexistent. Cost reduction is best achieved either through density economies associated with high capacity in the airline's markets or by reducing the price paid for the elements of production. Because these methods do not create substantial barriers, a cost leader must look for supplemental strategic approaches, completely shift strategic emphasis, or face the prospect of going out of business. Since the airlines were deregulated in 1978, a number of firms have either entered the industry or expanded beyond state boundaries to compete on a larger scale.

In this JOURNAL, Spraos (I980) presents evidence of a 'stable' declining commodity, terms of trade and Sapsford (i985), although fl'nding 'instability' in the work of Spraos, argues in support of the 'stable' declining terms of trade hypothesis. Grilli and Yang (I988), henceforth GY, also provide evidence supporting this view and state the implications of this finding for developing-country terms of trade. A major contribution of GY is a published set of data on the main price indices with a high degree of consistency for the whole century.1 However, Cuddington and Urzua (I989) in thisJOURNAL, illustrate that the hypothesis of a 'secular deterioration' in the commodity terms of trade is not robust to the alternative claim that there was a once-and-for-all shift in commodity prices in the period I920-I. After taking this shift into account these authors find little evidence to support the view of a 'secular decline'. 2 This debate has important implications for the 'Prebisch-Singer' hypothesis of a 'stable declining commodity terms of trade' (see for instance Prebisch, I 950) . It also has implications for both development and stabilisation strategies adopted by commodity-dependent developing countries. A central issue in this analysis is the order of integration of the commodity terms of trade. A time series is said to be integrated of order o, I(o), if its mean and variance are constant, or roughly speaking if the series is stationary. A time series is said to be I(n) if the series requires first differencing n times before a stationary series is obtained. Alternatively, if adding a time trend is sufficient to induce stationarity, the series is termed 'trend stationary'. A 'trend stationary' series implies that the variable in question simply adjusts around a constant growth path, but an I(i) series is truly non-stationary and displays very different properties. A commonly cited example of an 1(i) series is the random walk. The order of integration of a single time series is related to the idea of cointegration of a number of time series. Consider two variables, X and Y, that are not themselves I (o) but are of the same order of integration. If the residuals from regressing X on Y, or vice versa, are I(o), or roughly speaking if the residuals are stationary, it can be concluded that the two variables are cointegrated. In turn this implies that there is some form of equilibrium Collapse"

Those plans soon proved overly ambitious, but the long-run trend towards integration is nevertheless clear. The next successful project of the EC will most likely be enlargement to include those of the other Western European countries (members of EFTA European Free Trade Association) who wish to join.

They were suppliers of non-competing products. The attitudes of both those in and those studying developing countries may have been reinforced by the limited effects of their own trading groups and by the emphasis on domestic policies, aid and capital movements, rather than trade. When the EC was smaller geographically and economically, fewer countries were affected, and by less. 'I 992' came at a time of growing concern about the growth of protection in the United States and the EC, and its apparent persistence inJapan. Changes in production techniques and persistent slow growth in world output led to fears of a new retreat towards the centre in economic production, leaving the developing countries 'marginalised'. (Little empirical evidence can in fact be found to support this, and it appears to be based on an analysis of international trade in terms of absolute, rather than comparative, advantage.) There was also an increased sensitivity to how 'internal' measures like subsidies, regional aids, and government procurement could have external impacts as great as or greater than more traditional tariff on non-tariff barriers. The SEM was itself predicated upon the importance of such measures for intra-EC trade. It aimed at improving the performance of the European' economy relative to the rest of the world by international regulation of such 'internal' measures to increase the efficiency of production and markets in Europe.

Within the EC, the prevailing view has been steadfast in the expectation that the benefits of further integration will exceed the costs. This has been especially the case among European businessmen, who have been in the lead in this phase of economic integration.1 As the target date of I992 draws closer, however, the level of anxiety, especially about the costs of adjustment, appears to be rising in some sectors and some 2 countries. Attitudes in non-member countries, in both private and official circles, have varied. The initial response from the executive branch in the United States was favourable. There has, however, been considerable fear among U.S. business and labour leaders that completion of the internal market would be accompanied by a conversion of Europe into an economic 'fortress' with sharply reduced access to foreigners. In some European non-member countries - notably Austria and Sweden - the prevailing view favours membership. The insider-outside issue is still being debated in Switzerland and elsewhere and is likely to play a role in the trade strategies of a number of Eastern European countries. In North America, the United States has entered into a free trade agreement with Canada and is poised for negotiations with Mexico. Some have suggested that American interest in regional trading pacts has been motivated in part at least by a strategic desire to strengthen the United States' bargaining hand with the EC. While regionalism thus thrives, the trade talks of the Uruguay Round lie moribund. If completed as planned, the current process of economic integration in Europe will replace a group of national markets, segmented in various degrees by a proliferation of non-tariff barriers, with a single regional market. If plans for monetary integration also reach fruition, they will replace a system of multiple currency areas with a single regional currency domain. From the perspective of the outsider, there are three broad areas of concern about the external effects of the ongoing process of real and monetary integration in Europe. The first, which is discussed in Section II, deals with the implications of goods and resource market integration for outside industries and firms and for outside welfare generally.

This study finds that little of the participation rate gap can be attributed to traditional economic or institutional factors. For example, the high long-term unemployment rate in West Virginia accounts for less than 10 percent of the adult male participation gap. Most of the difference is associated with a large Appalachian population, and a high rate of federal disability benefits receipt. The latter, which we argue reflects tastes for nonmarket activities, also is a major factor in low participation rates of West Virginia adult females and teenagers. Unemployment does explain a significant portion of low participation rates for these groups. However, we estimate that a decline in the state's long-term unemployment rate to the nation's average would raise its aggregate participation rate by 3.9 percentage points, or just 28 percent of the total gap. It appears that nonparticipating West Virginians are not just “discouraged workers,” and that economic development policies should explore ways to increase aggregate labor supply, as well as labor demand.

114226,1991,inquiry,long-term care policy looms on the sidelines,long term care policy looms on the sidelines,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a form of chronic lung disease that develops primarily in preterm neonates. The pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial with contributors such as positive-pressure ventilation, oxygen toxicity, prematurity, genetic predisposition, infection, inflammation, and nutritional deficiencies appearing to play critical roles. The early use of less invasive treatment modalities (e.g., nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP)) and enhanced nutritional approaches (e.g., total parenteral nutrition (TPN), trophic enteral feedings) have resulted in the increased survival of extremely preterm neonates. Despite this, 40–60% of these neonates will develop BPD with approximately 15,000 new cases reported in the United States each year. BPD is associated with significant morbidity (respiratory, neurodevelopmental), mortality, and poor growth. The treatment of preterm neonates with BPD is often directed toward improving the pathophysiologic abnormalities after they occur. Additional strategies to prevent BPD and its associated morbidities are urgently needed. BPD has traditionally been defined as the need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. However, this definition has been the subject of intense debate as investigators attempt to link the development of BPD with more meaningful shortand longer-term clinically relevant outcomes, such as: (1) a requirement for home oxygen, (2) development of asthma, (3) repeated respiratory infections, (4) use of respiratory medications, (5) emergency room visits, and (6) hospital re-admissions. Because many of these outcomes commonly occur in preterm neonates without BPD, the contribution of BPD to the development of long-term respiratory dysfunction is unclear. These morbidities can even be seen in preterm neonates who never required positive-pressure ventilation. Despite this, BPD remains an extremely important sequela of neonates who require intensive care and is the only major complication of prematurity that continues to increase in frequency. In this issue of Pediatric Research, Panagiotounakou and colleagues evaluated respiratory function by spirometry and examined the frequency of lower respiratory tract infections, number of re-hospitalizations, and growth parameters in 108 former very preterm neonates (birth weight <1500 g and gestational age <32 weeks) from a single neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Greece and compared them to 70 term controls at 8 years of age. When the preterm and term groups were compared, there were no significant differences found in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity measured by spirometry nor respiratory tract infections and rehospitalizations up to 8 years of age. Also important was that no differences could be detected in any respiratory outcome in former preterm neonates who did and did not have a diagnosis of BPD, even though those with BPD had a significantly lower birth weight and gestational age. The authors suggested that their clinical practice of using nCPAP (with permissive hypercapnia) and enhanced delivery of protein (via TPN and early enteral feeds) was primarily responsible for the improved lung function at 8 years of age. These are care practices that have been adopted in many NICUs worldwide. While it is difficult to separate these two approaches from other potentially confounding clinical variables in the NICU as well as various post-discharge factors such as exposure to viral infections, cigarette smoke, and other environmental toxins, these data are provocative and worthy of more in-depth discussion. It has been over 30 years since Dr. Mary Ellen Avery observed that NICUs using more nCPAP have better respiratory outcomes than those using conventional mechanical ventilation. This has been followed by clinical trials such as SUPPORT which demonstrated that neonates treated with early nCPAP had better shortand longer-term respiratory outcomes than neonates treated with intubation and exogenous surfactant. This resulted in a major shift in treatment approach with a focus on less invasive ventilatory strategies. However, a recent study by Doyle et al. reported contrasting results. They compared short(incidence of BPD) and long-term (measurements of airflow) respiratory outcomes at 8 years of age in preterm neonates born in three time periods: 1991–92, 1997, and 2005. Despite a substantial increase in the use of nCPAP in the later time period, respiratory outcomes had not improved compared to periods when more intubation and surfactant was used. Preterm neonates have increased nutritional requirements because of increased metabolic needs and rapid growth requirements. If these increased energy and protein needs are not met, a catabolic state will develop, which likely contributes to the pathogenesis of BPD. Inadequate nutrition interferes with normal growth and maturation of the lung and may potentiate the deleterious effects of oxygen and mechanical ventilation. Osborn et al. performed a Cochrane Review to determine whether higher versus lower intake of amino acids administered through TPN is associated with improved growth and reduced incidence of complications, such as BPD. Data demonstrated varying effects on growth parameters and no significant impact on any Collapse"

114228,1991,inquiry,"health insurance, 1979-1989:  the frayed connection between employment and insurance",health insurance  1979 1989   the frayed connection between employment and insurance,"Using data from the Current Population Survey, this article shows that low-income workers were much less likely to have employer-sponsored insurance in 1989 than they were in 1979. For example, workers earning $6.00 per hour in 1989 were over 10 percentage points less likely to have employer sponsored health insurance than were workers earning $3.51 per hour in 1979 (the constant dollar equivalent of $6.00 per hour in 1989). The decline in employer sponsored coverage was confined to low income workers; coverage levels did not decline for workers earning $30,000 per year and more. The paper explores two types of explanations for the decline in coverage among low-income workers. First, the decline might have resulted from increases in the price of medical care, the cost of administering health insurance, and from a breakdown in the small group insurance market. Second, the decline might have resulted from changes in the structure of the economy that changed the types of jobs available to low-income workers. Since coverage declines among the self-employed parallel coverage declines among the employed, it seems likely that increases in the price of health insurance are a larger part of the cause for coverage declines than are changes in the structure of the economy, but further research on this question is needed.

The expected discounted cost for persons turning 65 in 1990 is $27,600. However, variation around this average is high. The 9% of persons expected to use at least 5 years of nursing home care will account for 64% of aggregate cost for the cohort; the 68% using less than 3 months of care will account for only about 1% of cost. The percentage of costs covered under alternative financing strategies also varies widely. An entitlement covering the first 3 months of care subject to 30% coinsurance would cover 5% of aggregate cost; an entitlement with a 2-year deductible and the same coinsurance would cover 41% of cost.

Characteristics of facilities, their market areas, and state Medicaid reimbursement were found to affect both participation and utilization. Most important, when Medicaid and private nursing home market conditions support high-intensity care, facilities are more likely to serve Medicare patients and admit more of them. SNFs in states that require Medicare certification are more likely to accept Medicare admissions, suggesting that the cost and effort of achieving certification are a barrier to service to Medicare SNF patients. For-profit facilities, hospital-based SNFs, and larger nursing homes have higher rates of participation and serve more Medicare patients when they serve any. Collapse"

The system, called Resource Utilization Group (RUG-II), aimed to limit nursing home cost growth and improve access to nursing homes by ""heavy-care"" patients. As in Medicare's prospective hospital reimbursement system, payments to nursing homes were based on a ""price,"" rather than facility-specific rates. With respect to cost growth, we observed considerable diversity among homes. Specifically, those nursing homes most financially constrained by the RUG-II methodology exhibited the slowest rates of cost growth; we observed higher cost growth among the homes least constrained. This higher rate of cost growth raises a question about the desirability of using a pricing methodology to determine nursing home payment rates. In addition to moderating cost growth, we also observed a significant change in the mix of patients admitted to nursing homes. During the first year of the RUG-II program, nursing homes admitted more heavy-care patients and reduced days of care to lighter-care patients. Thus, through 1986, the RUG-II program appeared to satisfy at least one of its major policy objectives. Collapse"

Drawing on a new national survey of physicians in large, multispecialty groups, we conclude that much of the hours differential is due to differences in nonpractice incomes and is likely to be permanent. However, due to reductions in family responsibilities for women and increases in nonpractice incomes for men, the differential should narrow somewhat as the current cohort of physicians ages. We also infer that the link between hours and practice choices may well account for much of the diversity of the literature. Collapse"
114233,1991,inquiry,rollover effects in gatekeeper programs:  cushioning the impact of restricted choice,rollover effects in gatekeeper programs cushioning the impact of restricted choice,"Public and private medical care plans that restrict the beneficiary's choice of providers have experienced rapid growth in the past decade as a means to contain costs and coordinate care. Such plans have been criticized for engendering beneficiary dissatisfaction and potentially impeding access to necessary care. Some of the objections to primary care ""gatekeeping"" may be diminished by recruiting the physician who served previously as the beneficiary's ""usual source of care"" to assume the role of formal gatekeeper. This study examines how persons whose gatekeepers were their regular source of care before plan implementation differed in their use and satisfaction from persons required to change their regular source of care. Our findings indicate that satisfaction was significantly higher among individuals who experienced no change in usual source of care. These individuals also tended to be less likely to use the emergency department as a source of care. Although the data are from Medicaid managed care programs, the findings may also be applicable to private sector point-of-service plans that adopt the primary care gatekeeper model. Collapse"

It finds that payments covered about 90% of Medicaid hospital costs until 1985, then declined to 78% in 1989. Together, Medicaid shortfalls ($4.2 billion) and unsponsored care ($8.9 billion) accounted for $13.1 billion in unreimbursed hospital costs in 1989. Most of the recent growth in unreimbursed hospital cost incurred in care for the poor is now caused by rising Medicaid shortfalls rather than increases in unsponsored care. While Medicaid shortfalls accounted for about one-fifth of unreimbursed care for the poor in 1980, they accounted for a third in 1989. Collapse"

Ninety percent of workers had medical insurance. Of these, 81% had coverage for alcohol abuse treatment and 75.5% had coverage for drug abuse treatment. The coverages were almost always offered together, and the benefits were generally identical for both. Coverage for inpatient detoxification was most common, followed by outpatient care and inpatient rehabilitation. Self-insured plans, although exempt from state-mandated benefits, were as likely to include alcohol and drug abuse coverage as Blue Cross and Blue Shield and commercial plans, and their specific benefits were no less generous. Coverage limitations tended to be more restrictive for these illnesses than for others. The nature of the limitations varied greatly, although day and dollar limits were most common for inpatient treatment, and visit limits and higher copayments were most common for outpatient treatment.

As part of an evaluation of Washington's Basic Health Plan (BHP), we conducted a telephone survey in nine Washington counties to estimate the percentage of people under the age of 65 who were uninsured. We used regression analysis to estimate the percentage uninsured in a county as a function of the percentage unemployed. Two validation approaches yielded very good results, suggesting that the equation could be used to estimate the percentage uninsured in unsurveyed counties. The variation ranged from 15% to 23% uninsured in the 9 surveyed counties, and was estimated to range from 9% to 35% among the state's 39 counties. With proper caution, estimates based on this equation can probably be used in other states if better data are unavailable. Collapse"

ARCO1, currently under development at the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) and the University of Southern California (USC), is the most advanced implementation of these models in a financial forecasting setting. ARCO1's underlying belief network is an artificial intelligence knowledge base; it models all variables believed to have an impact on the crude oil market. Decision analytic elicitation techniques collect information about the market's variables, their value ranges, and their interrelationsships. A pictorial market model - developed on a MAC II - facilitates consensus among the members of the forecasting team. The system forecasts crude oil prices via Monte Carlo analyses of the network. Several different models of the oil market have been developed; the system's ability to be updated quickly in light of recent events in the Persian Gulf highlights its flexibility."

The import relief determination made by the ITC is based on several factors that are specified in the federal trade acts, including the profitability of the industry. Explicit use of accounting numbers in import relief regulation provides incentives for managers to manage earnings in order to increase the likelihood of obtaining import relief and/or increase the amount of relief granted.

The value of public disclosure to traders is shown to vary dramatically with the structure of the private information market. It is also demonstrated that if firms are given the power to alter the structure of the private information market through selective private disclosures of information before any public release, traders may be made better off. These results are consistent with empirical observations regarding the public release of management earnings forecasts. It is observed that firms may privately inform securities analysts of earnings forecasts before public release (if any), apparently influencing the structure of the private information market. In the mid 1970s, the SEC, in response to this practice, attempted to mandate forecast disclosures. But this SEC action was strongly op- Collapse"

Investor capability in acquiring and processing information is an important issue to the accounting profession in the light of accounting regulators' perceived mandate to protect small, less sophisticated investors.1 Accounting regulation, however, is not the focus of the paper. The objective is to determine whether less sophisticated investors prefer the availability of more (or better quality) information useful for trading in a securities market. Availability of information is established as the result of a managerial decision to release information about the value of a firm intended to benefit all investors. Thus, if investors benefit from trading without information, then no information is disclosed. In contrast, when information is valuable, it is made available to all investors who, limited by their resources or ability to interpret the information, independently decide how much of the information they are able to use.

Among many possible sources of (abnormal) trading volume at the time of a public announcement, our emphasis in this study is on differences in the quality of preannouncement information. The study uses a two-period rational expectations model. Traders achieve their optimal portfolios prior to the announcement by trading on what each knows in the preannouncement period. The public announcement changes traders' beliefs and induces them to engage in a new round of trade. It is assumed that traders are diversely informed and differ in the precision of their private prior information; they therefore respond differently to the announcement, and this leads to positive volume. We obtain three results. First, the price change at the time of announcement is proportional to both the unexpected portion of the announcement and its relative importance across the posterior beliefs of traders. This relative importance is increasing in the precision of the announcement and decreasing in the precision of the preannouncement information. Collapse"

In addition to various kinds of publicly available information, such as accounting disclosures, an investor can also acquire private information for a cost. In such an environment, changes in accounting disclosure requirements may change investors' incentives to acquire private information, so part of the impact of a new accounting disclosure requirement may well be changes in the acquisition of private information. In an economy with informative prices, however, the allocation of private information must be determined as part of an overall equilibrium. As traders choose between signals from different information sources they rationally anticipate the information that will be freely available by observing the asset's price. But the informativensss of price depends on the allocation of private information. Thus an equilibrium model of the information environment must be used to assess the effect of different disclosure requirements. I consider an economy with two different sources of private information.

In addition, we explore the organizational uses of sales forecasts and budgets, the interplay of subgroups in trying to satisfy multiple objectives, and the sources of management forecasting error. Our analysis of sales volume forecasting errors (absent any knowledge of organizational influences or objectives of the decision makers) suggests that the firm can improve forecast accuracy by using statistical models instead of human judgment. This result confirms prior research which suggests that decision makers have difficulty in consistently applying their information processing strategies (Ashton [1984] and Libby [1981]). In interviews conducted to uncover the sources of prediction error, managers revealed that qualitative considerations and political maneuverings influenced the budgetary process. The company's accounting control system provided incentives for some managers to manipulate otherwise accurate sales volume predictions to satisfy conflicting budgetary objectives. Collapse"

MARS can be conceptualized as a generalization of recursive partitioning that uses spline fitting in lieu of other simple fitting functions. Given a set of predictor variables, MARS fits a model in the form of an expansion in product spline basis functions of predictors chosen during a forward and backward recursive partitioning strategy. MARS produces continuous models for high-dimensional data that can have multiple partitions and predictor variable interactions. Predictor variable contributions and interactions in a MARS model may be analyzed using an ANOVA style decomposition. By letting the predictor variables in MARS be lagged values of a time series, one obtains a new method for nonlinear autoregressive threshold modeling of time series. A significant feature of this extension of MARS is its ability to produce models with limit cycles when modeling time series data that... Collapse"

Daily returns for stocks in each of these industries and the random sample are obtained from the Center for Research in Security Prices tapes for the period July 1962 through December 1986 and are grouped into 98 quarter-year, and also 49 half-year, nonoverlapping time intervals. Beta is estimated for each interval. Our analysis indicates that the time series of beta is consistent with ARMA(1, 1). We found that the autoregressive parameter of the time series of beta estimated using a half-year interval is equal to the square root of the autoregressive parameter of the time series of beta using a quarter-year interval. Thus, as the length of time interval chosen to estimate beta becomes longer, the time series behavior of beta becomes less autoregressive and more random in nature. Collapse"

One criticism of EM in practice is that asymptotic variance–covariance matrices for parameters (e.g., standard errors) are not automatic byproducts, as they are when using some other methods, such as Newton–Raphson. In this article we define and illustrate a procedure that obtains numerically stable asymptotic variance–covariance matrices using only the code for computing the complete-data variance–covariance matrix, the code for EM itself, and code for standard matrix operations. The basic idea is to use the fact that the rate of convergence of EM is governed by the fractions of missing information to find the increased variability due to missing information to add to the complete-data variance–covariance matrix. We call this supplemented EM algorithm the SEM algorithm. Theory and particular examples reinforce the conclusion that the SEM alg... Collapse"

These reasons now include a whole taxonomy of possible biases. We take a closer look at one CVM format—the referendum—and demonstrate that simply the “luck of the draw” in assigning the referendum thresholds on individual questionnaires can produce a surprisingly wide variety of value estimates.

114364,1991,journal of the american statistical association,likelihood and bayesian prediction of chaotic systems,likelihood and bayesian prediction of chaotic systems,"Berliner (Likelihood and Bayesian prediction for chaotic systems, J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 1991) identified a number of difficulties in using the likelihood function within the Bayesian paradigm which arise both for state estimation and for parameter estimation of chaotic systems. Even when the equations of the system are given, he demonstrated ""chaotic likelihood functions"" both of initial conditions and of parameter values in the Logistic Map. Chaotic likelihood functions, while ultimately smooth, have such complicated small scale structure as to cast doubt on the possibility of identifying high likelihood states in practice. In this paper, the challenge of chaotic likelihoods is overcome by embedding the observations in a higher dimensional sequence-space; this allows good state estimation with finite computational power. An importance sampling approach is introduced, where Pseudo-orbit Data Assimilation is employed in the sequence-space, first to identify relevant pseudo-orbits and then relevant trajectories. Estimates are identified with likelihoods orders of magnitude higher than those previously identified in the examples given by Berliner. Pseudo-orbit Data Assimilation importance sampler exploits the information both from the model dynamics and from the observations. While sampling from the relevant prior (here, the natural measure) will, of course, eventually yield an accountable sample, given the realistic computational resource this traditional approach would provide no high likelihood points at all. While one of the challenges Berliner posed is overcome, his central conclusion is supported. ""Chaotic likelihood functions"" for parameter estimation still pose a challenge; this fact helps clarify why physical scientists maintain a strong distinction between the initial condition uncertainty and parameter uncertainty."

Bayesian analysis of such data requires specification of a prior for the regression parameters in the model used. Uniform priors are very commonly used as conventional noninformative priors. We show, however, that uniform priors for GLM's can lead to improper posterior distributions thus making them undesirable. Alternative reference priors may be constructed from Jeffreys's rule. In this article, we give two theorems that support the use of Jeffreys's priors for GLM's with intrinsically fixed or known scale parameters. These theorems provide (i) sufficient and (ii) necessary and sufficient conditions for the propriety of the (i) posterior and (ii) prior distributions as well as for the existence of moments. Implications of these theorems for some commonly used GLM's are discussed. Finally, an illustrative example is given for the binomial ... Collapse"
114367,1991,journal of the american statistical association,data base error trapping and prediction,data base error trapping and prediction,"Sir Sigurdsson et al. (1990) presented a method for dividing the values of a continuous prognostic variables into categories for the purpose of prediction in a Cox multiple regression model. There are some serious problems with their approach, especially the fact that the choice of cut-off is derived from the data. For statistical analysis it is sometimes useful to divide values of a continuous variable into categories. As these authors note, there is no generally accepted method for doing this. Although dichotomising at the median is a common procedure, many statisticians prefer to use three (or more) groups as this allows one to detect possible non-linear trends. Using three groups of equal size, as Meyer and Province (1988) did, is a reasonable approach. Another valid scheme is to have similar numbers of endpoints in each group. The key point about these (and similar) strategies is that they are specified without examination of the data. The serious problem with the approach advocated by Sigurdsson et al. (1990) is that it is data-dependent. They do not seem to realise the importance of this aspect, as they state that the main objection to their method is the sensitivity to the numbers of subjects in the groups. The essence of the authors' approach is to try every possible cut-off and plot the test statistic against the cut-off. It is true that the highest test statistic indicates the cut-off that maximises the fit to the sample data, but that should not be the objective. The whole point of analysing a sample of data is to make inferences about the relevant population (here breast cancer patients). The method of analysis suggested will inevitably overestimate the prognostic importance of the variable, perhaps considerably. Further, it invalidates the P value obtained. Indeed, there will be a considerably raised risk of 'detecting' a significant effect of a variable that is in reality not prognostic (i.e. a raised 'Type I' error rate) (see, for example, Halpern, 1982). A similar approach has been used by other authors (e.g. Courdi et al., 1988; Clark et al., 1989; Tandon et al., 1989; Coiffier et al., 1991), but this does not make the procedure valid. Some of these points were addressed by Courdi et al. (1988), in particular the need to adjust the P value for multiple testing. However, there is no recognised procedure for making this adjustment, and there is no corresponding adjustment to the estimated difference in prognosis between the two groups. Courdi et al. (1988) and Sigurdsson et al. (1990) observed that different authors have obtained different 'optimal' cut-off points, but did not seem to recognise the role of sampling variation in this context. We should expect different authors to find considerably different 'optimal' cutoffs for the same measurement in different samples from the same population. An adverse consequence of this type of analysis is that the results of different studies cannot be compared directly. All the authors cited seem to accept the desirability of dichotomising continuous variables. Apart from throwing away information, this procedure produces a biologically unrealistic model where the hazard (risk) has a sudden jump at the cut-off level, with all values above the cut-off having equal risk, and likewise for values below the cut-off. It is of course necessary to categorise continuous variables when producing Kaplan-Meier plots and performing logrank tests, but it is not necessary for Cox regression. I would prefer categorisation into three or more groups. Whether two or more groups are used the cut-point(s) should be defined before examining the data. On occasion it may be desirable to use familiar cut-off values for some variables, if they exist, so that results can be compared with those from other studies. There are further problems with the analysis performed by Sigurdsson et al. (1990). They chose two cut-points, presumably because there were two peaks in the plot of the chi squared statistic against the cut-off. However, the chi squared values are all based on dichotomising the data it does not follow that the values corresponding to the two peaks will give a useful grouping into three categories. Their procedure is further complicated by the strong relation between SPF and ploidy. The first cut-off for SPF (7%) seems to correspond to the value that best discriminates between diploid and non-diploid tumours. The second cut-off (12%) is above almost all SPF values in the diploid tumours, but around the median (11%) for non-diploid tumours. In other words, the cutpoints seem to reflect ploidy rather than SPF. Similarly, their Figure 3, which shows Kaplan-Meier plots for different groupings of SPF, is potentially misleading because no account was taken of the other prognostic variables which were adjusted for elsewhere in their paper (age, tumour size, nodal status and especially ploidy). I am not saying that S phase fraction is not prognostic in breast cancer. My point is that such a possibility should be investigated using valid statistical procedures that produce unbiased estimates and appropriate P values. Other researchers should not heed these authors' suggestion that the 'optimal' cut-off approach is the best way to analyse such data. Collapse"

Emphasis is placed on the estimation of the random effects and exploration of the relationships between them. Application is made to the investigation of several series of laboratory assay data that were observed during overlapping time intervals and were therefore subjected to common systematic errors, or “daily effects.” The motivation for this work was the need to investigate methods of adjustment for such daily effects, and to estimate the degree to which concurrently run series are impacted in common. Attention is given to the construction of confidence intervals for daily effects. Tractable methods are proposed that yield approximately correct coverage for large samples. Although derived within a Bayes-empirical Bayes framework, these intervals are somewhat similar to intervals constructed by the method of Kackar and Harville. Implement... Collapse"

114381,1991,journal of applied econometrics,to criticize the critics:  an objective bayesian analysis of stochastic trends,to criticize the critics an objective bayesian analysis of stochastic trends,"In two recent articles, Sims (1988) and Sims and Uhlig (1988) question the value of much of the ongoing literature on unit roots and stochastic trends. They characterize the seeds of this literature as ""sterile ideas,"" the application of nonstationary limit theory as ""wrongheaded and unenlightening"" and the use of classical methods of inference as ""unreasonable"" and ""logically unsound."" They advocate in place of classical methods an explicit Bayesian approach to inference that utilizes a flat prior on the autoregressive coefficient. DeJong and Whiteman adopt a related Bayesian approach in a group of papers (1989a,b,c) that seek to reevaluate the empirical evidence from historical economic time series. Their results appear to be conclusive in turning around the earlier, influential conclusions of Nelson and Plosser (1982) that most aggregate economic time series have stochastic trends. So far, these criticisms of unit root econometrics have gone unanswered; the assertions about the impropriety of classical methods and the superiority of flat prior Bayesian methods have been unchallenged; and the empirical reevaluation of evidence in support of stochastic trends has been left without comment. This paper breaks that silence and offers a new perspective. We challenge the methods, the assertions and the conclusions of these articles on the Bayesian analysis of unit roots. Our approach is also Bayesian but we employ objective ignorance priors not flat priors in our analysis. Ignorance priors represent a state of ignorance about the value of a parameter and in many models are very different from flat priors. We demonstrate that in time series models flat priors do not represent ignorance but are actually informative (sic) precisely because they neglect generically available information about how autoregressive coefficients influence observed time series characteristics. Contrary to their apparent intent, flat priors unwittingly bias inferences toward stationary and iid alternatives where they do represent ignorance, as in the linear regression model. This bias helps to explain the outcome of the simulation experiments in Sims and Uhlig and the empirical results of DeJong and Whiteman. Under flat priors and ignorance priors this paper derives posterior distributions for the parameters in autoregressive models with a deterministic trend and an arbitrary number of lags. Marginal posterior distributions are obtained by using the Laplace approximation for multivariate integrals along the lines suggested by the author (1983) in some earlier work. The bias from the use of flat priors is shown in our simulations to be substantial; and we conclude that it is unacceptably large in models with a fitted deterministic trend, for which the expected posterior probability of a stochastic trend is found to be negligible even though the true data generating mechanism has a unit root. Under ignorance priors, Bayesian inference is shown to accord more closely with the results of classical methods. An interesting outcome of our simulations and our empirical work is the bimodal Bayesian posterior, which demonstrates that Bayesian confidence sets can be disjoint, just like classical confidence intervals that are based on asymptotic theory. The paper concludes with an empirical application of our Bayesian methodology to the Nelson- Plosser series. Seven of the fourteen series show evidence of stochastic trends under ignorance priors, whereas under flat priors on the coefficients all but three of the series appear trend stationary. The latter result corresponds closely with the conclusion reached by DeJong and Whiteman (1989b) (based on truncated flat priors) that all but two of the Nelson-Plosser series are trend stationary. We argue that the DeJong-Whiteman inferences are biased toward trend stationarity through the use of flat priors and that their inferences are fragile (i.e., not robust) not only to the prior but also to the lag length chosen in the time series specification.

114395,1991,journal of banking and finance,an empirical investigation of the determinants of the supply of bank loans to less developed countries,an empirical investigation of the determinants of the supply of bank loans to less developed countries,"Abstract The Third World debt held by private financial institutions has created a number of controversies in international finance. One of them revolves around the ability of LDCs (less developed countries) to attract hundreds of billions dollars of loans at a relatively ‘low’ spread over the last decade. Some general explanations have focused on, for instance, error of judgement by banks and the ‘herd effect’, i.e., ignorant followers rushing in while the more knowledgeable have already gotten out. An intriguing explanation of the size of the sovereign loans has been offered by Agmon and Dietrich (1983) in terms of political factors pertaining to the lender's country: loans to LDCs are in effect global taxes imposed by LDCs on industrialized nations in terms of the nature of their political relationship. Unfortunately, the Agmon-Dietrich study was not subjected to any emphirical test. The purpose of this study is to extend the Agmon-Dietrich framework and examine the impact of the political relationship (between the borrowing country and the lending bank's government) on the supply of loans by commercial banks in recent times.

Our results indicate that (a) the RAA estimator is very sensitive to the quality of the instrument used in first-round estimation, and (b) model mis-specification may cause substantial differences in the finite-sample distributions of the two estimators. An empirical analysis of inventory equations suggests that adjustment speeds are more sensitive to model specification than to choice of estimator. Collapse"

Importantly, the typical assumption that the coefficients of the appliance dummies are fixed, ignores two important sources of variation: during any particular hour the intensity of use of a particular appliance will vary from household to household; also the dummies indicate only absence or presence of the appliance and do not allow for variations in size or capacity. Our treatment of the coefficients of appliance dummies as random rather than fixed provides a structure for the heteroskedasticity that has been observed in previous studies of this kind. Also included in the analysis is the utilization of other sources of information in particular from direct metering and a sample of diaries. The resultant single equation specifications for individual hours are then pooled and jointly estimated using an SUR structure. Collapse"

This is the multivariate analog of work by Andrews (1991). Our proof strategy is new and consists of relating the minimum eigenvalue of the sample sum of squares and cross-products matrix to the minimum eigenvalue of the population matrix via a uniform strong law with rate that is established using results from the empirical processes literature. In its customary form, the minimum eigenvalue of the Fourier sum of squares and cross-products matrix, considered as a function of the number of parameters, decreases faster than any polynomial. The consequence is that the rate at which parameters may increase is slower than any fractional power of the sample size. In this case, we get the same rate as Andrews. When our results are applied to multivariate regressions with a minimum eigenvalue that is bounded or declines at a polynomial rate, the rate on the parameters is a fractional power of the sample size. In this case, our method of proof gives faster rates than Andrews. Andrews' results cover the heteroskedastic case, ours do not. Collapse"

114611,1991,journal of economic perspectives,the lessons of limited market-oriented reform,the lessons of limited market oriented reform,"Having experienced several decades of successful and unsuccessful economic reforms, Hungary serves as an excellent laboratory to test theories of institutional change. While generalizations based on a single case are always limited by nature, it may still contribute to the better understanding of general conditions of policy and institutional changes for the better as well as impediments to them. On Long Waves of Institutional Change Nearly a quarter of a century ago this author attempted to summarize the achievements and limits of the socialist market economy in Hungary for much of the same audience/Csaba, 1989/. The bottom line of the paper, which I think remains valid, is that the individual case shows the relevance of the political constraints on how far any reform attempt may go, while it remains socialist in nature. Nowadays Hungary is one of the least successful cases of the countries that acceded to the European Union in its northern and eastward enlargements following the collapse of the Soviet Empire. Why has such an early bird become a laggard in terms of performance, whilst not having experienced any major cataclysm over the past 25 years? In this paper we continue and extend this analysis. For one, if we constrain our analysis to transition to the market proper, Hungary still counts among the unquestionable success stories in managing this historic process, even if we put her development in a broad global comparative perspective/cf Fosu,ed, 2012/. However, if we posit that transition, narrowly understood, is introducing institutions of a market economy, this task must have been accomplished before entering the EU. If for no other reasons, but the Copenhagen criteria for have explicitly required this task be mastered prior to accession. Furthermore the EU – represented by the Commission – undertook a thorough checking on the ground, if transposition of its rules actually happened in the process of acquis screening. Only after the performance was deemed satisfactory, first by the Commission and later by the Council and Parliament, accession could materialize in 2004, i.e 15 years after transition began. This was among the longest processes recorded to date, if we disregard that of Turkey, which still continues. Therefore, it was only legitimate to expect that joining the Community of stability, security and prosperity would foster internal changes and improve long term performance of the country. First, membership was conditional upon introducing more time-consuming reforms. These included environmental, social and other changes, but most importantly an obligation to join the Eurozone “in a foreseeable period of time” usually estimated at 4-6 years at worst. Secondly, it was hoped that improving the strategic position of the country would trigger a major inflow of new foreign direct investment, outpacing the already increasing outward FDI from Hungary to the east and the south. Thirdly, it was also postulated that convergence to the policies of the core EU countries would improve the quality of overall macroeconomic management. Fourthly, it was widely believed that membership in a currency bloc, or even the prospect of joining in, would ward off any major external shocks that may originate in the global economy. Finally, the synergy among the above listed was taken for granted and thus credit was given to the conventional models of economic integration postulating a steady convergence to the countries with a higher level of development. It is all the more surprising to observe that catching up started to ebb well before the eruption of the global financial crisis in 2008-9. Moreover, Hungary, having been accustomed to a leader position in terms of systemic reforms ever since the late 1960s, had lost momentum by 2002-2003. It happened just at the time of EU entry would have called for – and allowed for – radicalizing structural reforms. Ever since the slowdown of growth, the increase in unemployment, the stagnant international competitiveness, explosion of public and private debt and sustaining high inflation indicate the cumulative costs of doing nothing . Thus we come to one of the more unpleasant insights of policy reform literature. Namely that the positionand the edge of the ‘early bird’ can easily be lost. Furthermore, that performance must always be seen in comparative perspective. If Hungary’s peers outperformed her, even a per se sufficient delivery qualifies as inadequate. For instance, the 16.2 thousand euro per capita GDP in purchasing power parity, where Hungary stood at the end of 2010 was about the same, 66.3 pc of the EU average a decade ago. However, in the same period countries that historically fell behind Hungary approached and even overtook her. Poland, always significantly poorer than Hungary in the past century, reached exactly 16.0 thousand euros per capita. Even more strikingly, Estonia, coming from the internal Soviet Empire, overtook Hungary with 16.5 thousand euros, despite the 3.7 pc contraction in 2008 and the even steeper fall of 14.3 per cent in 2009, hardly made up by the growth of a mere 2.3 pc in 2010. Similarly Slovakia, which tended to be the poorest part of the historical Hungarian Kingdom – the Highlands – took over by 19.0 thousand euros per capita, and even being able to adopt the single currency since 2007. In short, the country’s relative performance was indeed dismal and in need of explanation. We attempt to paint the broad picture in uncovering the reasons behind the derailment. We leave analysis of the nitty-gritty to other papers and continue the broad comparative theoretical endeavour started a quarter of a century ago. We therefore purposefully omit the analysis of individual measures and non-measures of various governments, which is the task of an economic historian, or of current commentary. Instead we stick to what may be relevant for other countries and for broader economic theory from our interpretation of both success, in 1989-2002, and derailment, in the following decade. This is not to belittle the significance of studying bits and pieces, but we are opting for a different genre. We are interested not in the immediate background, but in what is the mover behind the mover, i.e. those factors which may explain the long run tendencies, not the individual policy moves. Lessons are formulated, albeit in a tentative manner. Reform Socialist Heritage: Burden and Blessing? Hungary underwent a series of economic reforms in the 1953-1988 period/Révész, 1990/, thus it has never fitted into the textbook view of a Soviet type command economy. Without reiterating those changes that attracted much attention at the time, let us recall: state property went into managers’ hands; prices were gradually freed and so was foreign trade; FDI was liberalized and the country exited Comecon by starting to trade in convertible currency with the Soviet Union in 1990. Also in institutional and political terms most of what counts as tasks of first stage of transition was mastered by the outgoing regime, from establishing commercial banks to allowing for multi-party democracy. True, these changes happened under constant pressure and were outcomes of erosion, not of constructivist foresight. Thus Hungary did enjoy the advantage of being an ‘early bird’ in terms of systemic reforms, transcending the straightjacket of Socialism. Many of the changes on the ground happened in a largely spontaneous fashion, as the spread of the irregular economy, or the erosion of public authority and the emergence of various forms of private activities, in the economy and polity alike. Many of the changes listed above, as e.g. currency liberalization, happened in an ad hoc manner, rather than following secret master plans. The round table negotiations of May-October 1989 followed the Polish example and led to truly free elections and an exclusively non-communist government by May, 1990, when the USSR was still intact and was stationing troops in Hungary. For this it must have been inevitable, that managed transition tended to be associated with the outgoing regime and its successors, the Socialist Party, and resistance to communism often went hand in hand with dislike for market-oriented arrangements, and not only in the field of funding high culture. Economic platforms of the anti-communist parties/Laki, 1991/ were in part utopian, in part statist, exclusive and anti-market in nature. This feature, which is quite odd for west European standards of political science, has survived the following two decades. Still, on the ground, exigencies of governance pushed the first centre-right government of József Antall into much more market friendly policies than their language would have suggested. Most of the institutional reforms, including the law on banking, the tough law on bankruptcy and most big privatizations to strategic western investors were completed on time. By adopting the Kupa programme of 1991, the conservatives committed themselves to what was, by and large, a continuation of systemic changes of the preceding period. In the parliamentary cycle of 1990-94 macroeconomic performance remained weak. This was only to be expected, as institutional reforms need time to bite. But this was exactly the opposite of the contemporary public mood, which expected quick improvement. Reality was otherwise, with output – 40 pc of industrial and 20 pc of overall – lost, mostly forever. While restructuring did go on, thereby laying the groundwork for future improvements, unemployment skyrocketed to 13 per cent by 1992. This was a real shock to both the economy and society alike. Recovery in the years 1993-95 was limited and short lived, running into a balance of payments constraint. This was reflected in an IMF rescue package in March, 1995, following the Mexican debacle and bailout in November, 1994. Following the adjustment measures recovery started from 1997 and lasted for nearly a decade, until 2006. This Collapse"

I examine whether the neoclassical model satisfies an essential condition to qualify for this role: does it give us a satisfactory explanation for the vast differences in performance between capitalist and socialist economic systems? First, I focus on the theoretical arguments that have traditionally been used to examine the comparative properties of central planning and markets. I show that developments within theory over the last 20 years have substantially changed the tone of these arguments, making their message more equivocal. Next I discuss empirical evidence, but of a particular sort. Much research shows that centrally planned economies perform less well than market economies; but few studies test whether the superiority of market economies appears within empirical models derived using the framework of basic neoclassical economics. Those studies are the relevant ones for the present exercise. The central conclusion is that economists must look outside the standard models of competition, the focus on Pareto-efficient resource allocation, and the welfare theorems to build a theory of reform.

In addition, they will be unable to promote the growth of multilateral impersonal trade.

114614,1991,journal of economic perspectives,the process of socialist economic transformation,the process of socialist economic transformation,"This twenty-seventh volume of the Socialist Register is primarily devoted to the daunting questions posed for socialists by the transformations which the USSR and the former Communist regimes of Eastern Europe are going through. The editors of and contributors to the Socialist Register over the past quarter century have fostered no illusions regarding the dictatorial nature of these regimes, and have presented over the years many analyses of their limits and contradictions. The emergence of ""glasnost"" in the USSR since 1985 followed by the dramatic democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe in 1989-90 were events of great historic importance, and they appeared to offer some promise for positive developments in international relations as well as for democratic socialist prospects. Today, we must ask what already remains of such promise as we witness the prospects for democratic socialism marginalized by capitalist and chauvinist forces and sentiments in Eastern Europe and the USSR, not to mention the growing economic and military ruthlessness of an unchecked global capitalism lustily proclaiming its ""new world order"". The Left must reassess the whole Communist experience, and draw appropriate lessons, in light of the collapse of authoritarian communism; it must do so, however, also mindful of the costs and consequences of an authoritarian capitalism rushing in to pick up the pieces. The essays in this volume attempt to understand the aftermath of Communist regimes in terms of its global as well as local political, economic and ideological implications, including the implications it has for the meaning and prospects of democratic socialism. While they also analyze the long-term, internal and external, causes of the crisis of the authoritarian communism, their primary focus is on providing detailed accounts of current developments, above all in relation to investigating the contradictory nature of the simultaneous processes of ""democratization"" and ""marketization"", and the complex old and new social forces, ideas and struggles involved. Regardless of whether our contributors see the Communist regimes as having represented the distortion and ultimate failure of a particular kind of socialism, or as never having amounted to any kind of socialism at all due to their divorce between socialism and democracy, the conclusions they draw regarding what is happening in the aftermath of Communist regimes still point to democratic socialism as the only humane alternative. The most daunting questions this volume raises, therefore, are those concerned with how to go about making viable the vision and prospect of democratic socialism at the end of the twentieth century.

In the framework of democratic institutions this transfer of ownership requires a certain measure of support. Using survey data collected in 1991 popular support for privatization is shown to be correlated with attitudes toward economic transition, entrepreneurship, a free market economy and a dimishing role of the State. Support for privatization was also determined by location in the social structure. Privatization was more suported by those individuals who were younger, more highly educated, male, and had higher monthly incomes. In relative terms, attitudes toward economic and political life proved to be better predictors of support for privatization than variables characteristics individuals' location in the social structure.

It is shown that casting a vote may well be a rational act, following from an individual cost-benefit analysis. It is argued that (reference-)group interests play an important role when an individual determines actions in the political sphere. Through its (relative) turnout, a group can affect future tax rates to which its members are liable, and an optimal turnout level is derived for each group. Using this optimal level, within-group processes are analyzed, where certain group members (‘producers of social pressure’) try to convince others to go and vote. For these producers, voting is shown to be a rational act. Other members may give in to this pressure and be induced to cast a vote. These members may be thought to vote out of a sense of ‘civic duty’. Equilibria for the model, characterized by positive turnout, are derived, an example is presented, and the results are discussed.

Economic theories have traditionally acknowledged psychological factors in saving such as self-control, fear of economic uncertainty and pessimism about the economy. Katona (1975) has been particularly influential in suggesting that people's beliefs about the economy mediate their saving. However, subsequent attempts to predict savings using economic and psychological variables have met with limited success. The present study used a wide range of economic, demographic and psychological variables to distinguish between savers and non-savers and to predict recurrent saving and total savings. Two hundred and seventy-nine people completed in-depth surveys of their economic conditions, their social background and a variety of psychological predictors. Discriminant function analysis was used to discriminate between savers and non-savers. A variety of psychological factors discriminated those who save regularly from those who do not. Using multiple regression analysis, both recurrent and total saving were predicted by economic variables, recurrent saving was predicted also by psychological variables and total savings by demographic variables. Implications for the role of psychological factors in saving are discussed. Collapse"
114635,1991,journal of economic psychology,merit criteria as justification for differences in earnings,merit criteria as justification for differences in earnings,"Abstract A professional income can be considered as part of an exchange between an individual (e.g. employee) and a social group (company or society). From this framework two different meanings of the term ‘merit’ are deduced: the individual worker stresses the efforts he has shown and expects a fair recompensation in return; the social group emphasizes the results for the community and tries to maximize collective productivity. Both conceptions lead to different notions of how ‘merit’ should be rewarded. This is particularly relevant for situations where different merit criteria interact or where the effort produced by the individual does not lead to results, e.g. due to circumstances or failure. We confront these theoretical considerations to some empirical data, illustrating the complexity of distributive decisions, even in fairly simple situations. In general, our subjects highly reward efforts produced, but only on the assumption that they will lead to more or better results. When this assumption is violated explicitly in the case description, most respondents solve the conflict by resorting to an equal distribution. Collapse"

One dimension of the gender-based determinants of career success that has received considerable attention in recent years is the phenomenon of gender-based attitudes. The general argument is that, relative to men, women as a group fare less well in their careers because of their own pessimistic attitudes concerning the probability that their expenditures of time and effort will result in career success. The result of such behavior may over time affect the productivity, and even the ability, of women to perform their jobs. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the determinants of the attitudes of male and female career managers to the gender of bureaucratic superiors and to determine to what extent variation among subordinate career managers in their attitudes concerning the gender of superiors is in fact determined by gender itself and to what extent it is determined by non-gender factors. A multivariate log-linear probability model is used to estimate the determinants of attitudes to the gender of superiors and to estimate the joint probability of gender, meritocratic, and awareness factors in determining these attitudes. The data base was generated by means of a questionnaire, designed specifically for managers and was distributed to 800 middle managers employed by a major company in nine separate regions in Canada.

First, we find clear evidence that both occupational segregation and industrial segregation declined during these years. Second, high employment growth within an occupation is associated with declines in segregation. Third, declines in industry segregation within occupation are associated with improvements in relative female earnings independently of other factors which affect relative pay. Fourth, high employment growth is associated with improvements in relative female earnings, independently of its effect on occupational segregation. As a result, employment growth acts to reduce the wage gap directly, possibly by lowering barriers to women finding jobs at high wage firms, and also indirectly by lowering the degree of industrial segregation. These results thus suggest that barriers or discrimination against women tend to be lower in sectors where demand is strong. Collapse"

The principal an Fauve, discussed a variety of systems, including our old favorite, Rayleigh-Benard convection, but passing on to exotic examples such as vertically vibrated granular layers. Fauve's lectures emphasize a unified theoretical viewpoint based on symmetry arguments. Patterns produced by instabilities can be described by amplitude equations, whose form can be deduced by symmetry arguments, rather than the asymptotic expansions that have been the staple of past Summer GFD Programs. The amplitude equations are far simpler than the complete equations of motion, and symmetry arguments are easier than asymptotic expansions. Symmetry arguments also explain why diverse systems are often described by the same amplitude equation. Even for granular layers, where there is not a universally accepted continuum description, the appropriate amplitude equation can often be found using symmetry arguments and then compared with experiment. Our second speaker, Daniel Rothman, surveyed the state of the art in lattice gas computations. His lectures illustrate the great utility of these methods in simulating the flow of complex multiphase fluids, particularly at low Reynolds numbers. The lattice gas simulations reveal a complicated phenomenology much of which awaits analytic exploration. The fellowship lectures cover broad ground and reflect the interests of the staff members associated with the program. They range from the formation of sand dunes, through the theory of lattice gases, and on to two dimensional-turbulence and convection on planetary scales.

114767,1991,journal of human resources,opportunistic behavior by firms in implicit pension contracts,opportunistic behavior by firms in implicit pension contracts,"Several studies have established that under the most common form of pension coverage, benefits accrue disproportionately near the end of a worker's career. Such backloading establishes a penalty for early quitting but may also create an incentive for opportunistic firm behavior. Because benefits generally are a function of highest earnings, when nominal earnings are expected to rise, an employer can reduce pension liabilities by discharging workers prior to retirement. This paper uses the National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Men to test whether such actions by employers are systematic. We estimate that pension-covered workers with mean losses are less likely to be discharged. Unexpected increases in pension losses due to increases in inflation, however, raise the risk of discharge. We find no evidence that the minimum vesting standards of the Employees' Retirement Income Security Act reduces the likelihood of discharge for older workers who previously were not vested. These results are consistent with an implicit pension contract under which employer compliance is enforced by reputation. Collapse"

Until the crisis hit, CESEE countries had been pursuing a distinctive model of growth and catch-up through integration with the European Union, although not all countries had achieved the same level of integration with the EU. The crisis was a major challenge for the policies pursued in many CESEE countries, and the region was hit by the crisis much harder than other parts of the emerging world, and is also recovering more slowly. In chapter 1, we compare the pre-crisis development model of the central, eastern and south-eastern Europe (CESEE) region with similar countries in Asia and Latin America and study the impact of the crisis. We highlight that the CESEE growth model was fundamentally different from models in other emerging country regions, but also that it had two variants. The first, which characterised most central European countries, was by and large appropriate and sustainable. But there is a second group of CESEE countries (we call it the Baltic-Balkan group) in which the same overall growth model led to widespread misallocation of resources and unsustainable growth trajectories. These countries are undergoing a much more painful recovery from the crisis. In chapter 2 we scrutinise more closely the growth model of the region. We study the short-run challenges and the medium- to longer-run issues, focusing on behavioural adjustments occurring within the countries of the region in the wake of the crisis and on changes in the external environment. We discuss policy issues to make the re-oriented growth model sustainable and successful. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 examine three key policy areas: exchange-rate policy, financial stability and fiscal sustainability. We identify a strong role for exchange-rate policy both in the unsustainable pre-crisis developments of a number of countries and in their dramatic response to the crisis. However, concerning the other two main policy areas, it is true more generally that even more conservative domestic financial regulation and supervision and fiscal policy could not have crisis-proofed those CESEE countries which, even before the crisis, had double-digit current-account deficits. Looking forward, improving supply side conditions and competitiveness will be a key challenge for most countries in the region. Massive cross-border holdings in CESEE banks pose significant challenges to financial regulation and we highlight a large number of unresolved issues, while for fiscal sustainability we are cautiously optimistic, but certainly more optimistic than most analysts who call for overly strict, and hence pro-cyclical, fiscal policy. In our concluding chapter 6, we raise policy issues for the CESEE countries and the EU. The general conclusion is that the benefits of EU integration for countries that are catching up are conditional on the quality of national policies and of the EU framework itself. In both respects we point out past failings and suggest strategic improvements. Reorienting the growth model in those countries that entered a shunt-line before the crisis will be hard because of their legacies, but that there is no other path to follow in order to make the EU’s eastern enlargement a lasting economic success story.

It is typical for economists to focus on the price system as the mechanism used to achieve this efficient allocation. An impersonal auction system is often in the back of most economists' minds when they think of efficient resource allocation. Other mechanisms to allocate goods, such as rationing, are usually considered inferior to a price system and are not given much attention.' The economist's exclusive focus on price comes from an implicit assmption that use of the price system is costless. After all, if it is costless to use the price system to achieve an efficient allocation, why not use it? This article explains that economists' faith in the price system is misplaced from the viewpoint of both theory and evidence. Prices alone should not be viewed as the most efficient way of allocating goods in many industries.

Our discussion of the effects of the tax environment includes estimates of the impact on buyout-related deductions of two major pieces of tax legislation: the Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA) of 1981 and the Tax Reform Act (TRA) of 1986. These estimates provide evidence on the sensitivity of buyout-related tax subsidies to specific features of the code. Presumably, these sensitivities will help determine trends in future tax-driven restructurings. One focus of our analysis of the tax environment is the alleged tax incentives ERTA provided for acquisitions.

Before World War I, there was a considerable literature, associated with such names as Vilfredo Pareto, Gaetano Mosca, and Robert Michels, which argued in one form or another that power in organizations tends to be concentrated in the hands of small elites. This is true regardless of the intended purpose of the organization. The most striking analysis is Michels's study of the German Social Democratic party. An organization devoted by its nature to spreading political power widely among the entire working class was itself run by a relatively small and self-perpetuating group.

One of the most praiseworthy intellectual activities with which an economist can become engaged is to identify and explicate spontaneous control mechanisms through which hands-off governance operates. Not only does it take a powerful mind-or, usually, the combined efforts of many powerful minds-to discover and model the mechanisms of spontaneous governance, but the benefits are stupendous.

Many studies evaluate these policies from the perspective of political economy but few examine the topic from a balanced ethical perspective. This paper applies natural law theories to evaluate state and local economic development policies and in the process emphasizes the principles of life, friendship, knowledge, beauty, playfulness, and justice. It also stresses the importance of social deliberation in resolving value conflicts in the policymaking process. Introduction In the new global economy where capital is internationally mobile and localities face stronger competitive pressure daily, economic development is a hard challenge for state and local governments especially over the past two decades (Clarke and Gaile, 1998; Eisinger, 1995). From the emphasis of using tax incentives in the 1980s to the recent emphasis on long-term growth and infrastructure needs, state and local governments created many tools to attract new investment, secure job opportunities, and increase labor productivity. Although common today, regarding income and job growth as the ultimate goals of economic development is a very limited view. As early as in the 1960s, economists who studied developing countries pointed out that ""economic development"" should be more than economic growth and should include concerns of social development, such as education and public health (Black, 1966: pp. 55-60; Meier, 1984: pp. 5-6.) Following this tradition, this paper defines ""economic development"" more broadly as a process of creating and managing economic growth with the objective of enhancing residents' quality of living and providing support for the pursuit of human values. Investment and jobs are only tools to reach those broader ends of economic development. Economic growth is not necessarily ""development"" if it produces changes that hinder human progress and pursuit of social well being. Therefore, economic development is not simply industrial development or an increase in business investment. It is also a quest for the ""good"" of society. Both quantitative and qualitative concerns of economic growth are equally important. Before asking, ""How to create faster growth?"" policymakers need to ask, ""What should we accomplish with growth and what progress will it bring to our society?"" Since a discussion of ""What is good?"" is a value question, economic development inevitably involves ethical considerations. Ethics should therefore be the primary theoretical and even political foundation for economic development and in fact almost all government decisions. Such emphasis on the relationship between ethics and policymaking and public administration is not new. For instance, the ""new public administration"" in the 1960s advocated that public administrators should encourage public participation and protect the interests of the minority and the disadvantaged (Marini, 1971). Ethical principles, such as benevolence, efficiency, fairness, justice, and responsiveness to clients, are often advocated as policy and administrative guidelines for the government (Denhardt, 1991; Worthley and Grumet, 1983). There are diverse philosophical foundations for ethical principles in public administration and policymaking (Denhardt, 1991, p. 91; Rohr, 1990, p. 97). Using state and local economic development policies as the focus, this paper suggests that we should apply natural law philosophy to guide ethical decisions in policymaking. By natural law, I mean an ethical approach believing that there are inherent ethical principles in nature that should guide our decision-making. Theories of natural law assert that these fundamental principles are important to human well being and societies should therefore follow these principles in their pursuits. From the classical work of political philosophers, many people believed that natural law philosophy is theologically based and therefore is less applicable to today's pluralistic society. … Collapse"

Recently, levine and Renelt (1992) encouraged by new developments in growth theory investigated, within a unified framework, the effet of a number of variables on per capita growth. The authors found that there was no robust srelationship between the two variables. On the contrary, fisher (1991-1993) using the Levine and Renelt growth equation approach supports the convetional view that inflation is an important determinant of the rate of economic growth and that the effects of important determinant of the rate of economic growth and that the effets of inflation are stronger at low and moderate inflation levels. Levine and Zervos (1992) include in the same framework an index of economic policy and concluded that growth and low inflation low budget deficit are positively correlated. Additional evidence supporting a negative relationship between inflation and growth can also be found in De Long and Summers (1992) and De Gregorio (1993), among others. The predominantly negative correlation between inflation and growth observe in the data has not been properly rationalized in models where identical agents behave rationally and where money has a significant impact of the evolution of real variables. In monetary versions of the neoclassical growth model the quantitative importance of money is quite modest inducing only small growth and welfare effects and playing almost no role in explaing the fluctuations of real variables. Because of the same reason, these models have not been successful at identifying a channel through which inflation plays a more meaningful role in the economy. There are numerous plausible channels through which may affect growth and welafre. However, the implications of many of them have not been fully explored or the simply have not been successful. Feasible channels are nominally denominated depreciation allowances, partially indexed tax bracketing, eserve requiriment on bank deposists, invetment purchases subjet to cash-in advance (CIA) constrain (Stockman, 1981), investment purchases and labor service payments subject to CIA constraint (Chistiano, 1991) etc. Nevertheless, as a result of this research program, the distorting effects of inflation on the labor leisure choice has risen as the basic mechanism at work in monetary models . In models with no growth (Cooley and Hansen, 1989), inflation reduces labor effort through its effect on the return to working because part of the labor income has to be carried over,as cash balances, into the next period’s cashgood trade. In models with endogenous growth (Gomme, 1993; Jones and Manuelli, the rate of growth of the economy. Within the first type of models, the welfare cost of a 10% inflation rate was calculated in 0.4% of income; within the second, Gomme (1993) computes a welfare cost of less than 0.03% of income for a 8.5% inflation rate. This kind of evidence endorses the generally accepted conclusion that welafre costs of inflation are very samall and they are even smaller in models with endogenous growth(1). In this paper I explore one alternative avenue through which inflation can have real effects and estimate its quantitative importance. The assumption that taxes are directly collected in money is imposed to capture the real world feature that money is the requiered means of taxation payment. Most, if no all, of the literature has studied econmies in which money exclusively has a private use (to buy goods or assetes or factor payments) ignoring its public use in taxation and the fact that they are closely related in modern economic arrangements where the value of money is not tied down to gold or any other kind of backing. It has long been recognized that if the government “(..) declines to accept some kind of money in payment of obligations to itself, it is difficult to believe that it would retain much of its general acceptability. (...) Its general acceptability, which is its all-important attribute, stands or falls by its acceptability by the state” (Lener, 1947). In consequence, it is natural to consider an economy in which money fulfills two functions: the government accepts money from households in the settiement of tax liabilites and money is used as a medium of exchange.

114874,1991,"journal of money, credit, and banking",the sustainability of budget deficits with lump-sum and with income-based taxation,the sustainability of budget deficits with lump sum and with income based taxation,"The paper examines the substantiality of fiscal policies in a stochastic economy with a particular focus on two benchmark policies, balanced budgets and tax smoothing. These policies are typically sustainable if lump-sum taxes are available, but they are generally not sustainable in a stochastic environment, if taxation is constrained by the size of the economy. The sustainability problems arise because the debt-income ratio becomes excessive whenever there are sufficiently low realizations of aggregate income. I also compute the probability of reaching high debt-income ratios with different policies and I discuss the role of debt management for sustainability. It turns out that balanced budgets can be sustained forever with very high probability (but less than one), but so can policies with permanent primary or with-interest deficits. I argue that debt management is important for sustainability in a stochastic environment and show that the use state-contingent government liabilities can be helpful in designing sustainable versions of tax-smoothing and balanced budget policies.

Such ballistic conclusions are generally terrorist weapons: they create sound, fury, and overtime, but in the end they have little consequence as long as, once publicized, they are ignored.
